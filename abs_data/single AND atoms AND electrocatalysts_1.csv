Metal-Organic Frameworks Driven Electrocatalytic and Photocatalytic Hydrogen Production: A Mini-Review,"© 2022 by the authors.The fabrication of economic electrocatalysts having high hydrogen evolution reaction ability and durability is one of the major challenges of hydrogen-based technologies. For the development of hydrogen fuel cell technology, it is equally crucial to have an easy way to produce hydrogen as a source of fuel. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs)-driven materials are considered among the most promising electrocatalysts for hydrogen generation among the available economic electrocatalysts, including single-atom electrocatalysts, metal oxides, phosphides, sulfides, and so on. This is because of their chemically adjustable and well-defined architecture and pore size with high intrinsic electrical conductivity. This work discusses successful manufacturing techniques for MOF-based electrocatalysts, recent advances in their usage for hydrogen generation, and prospects for MOF engineering for hydrogen generation.",Biointerface Research in Applied Chemistry
Electrochemical removal of ammonium nitrogen in high efficiency and N2 selectivity using non-noble single-atomic iron catalyst,"© 2022Ammonia nitrogen (NH4+-N) is a ubiquitous environmental pollutant, especially in offshore aquaculture systems. Electrochemical oxidation is very promising to remove NH4+-N, but suffers from the use of precious metals anodes. In this work, a robust and cheap electrocatalyst, iron single-atoms distributed in nitrogen-doped carbon (Fe-SAs/N-C), was developed for electrochemical removal of NH4+-N from in wastewater containing chloride. The Fe-SAs/N-C catalyst exhibited superior activity than that of iron nanoparticles loaded carbon (Fe-NPs/N-C), unmodified carbon and conventional Ti/IrO2-TiO2-RuO2 electrodes. And high removal efficiency (> 99%) could be achieved as well as high N2 selectivity (99.5%) at low current density. Further experiments and density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrated the indispensable role of single-atom iron in the promoted generation of chloride derived species for efficient removal of NH4+-N. This study provides promising inexpensive catalysts for NH4+-N removal in aquaculture wastewater.",Journal of Environmental Sciences (China)
Engineering the interface of porous CoMoO3 nanosheets with Co3Mo nanoparticles for high-performance electrochemical overall water splitting,"© 2022The design of high-performance electrocatalysts for alkaline water splitting is of significant importance for the development of a sustainable hydrogen economy. Herein, heterostructured Co3Mo nanoparticles/porous CoMoO3 nanosheets (Co3Mo/CoMoO3 NPSs) were constructed for alkaline water splitting by annealing CoMoOx nanosheets under controlled atmospheres. Thanks to its interfacial electronic structure and increased electrochemical active area, Co3Mo/CoMoO3 NPSs exhibit impressive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity with an overpotential of 334 mV at 1000 mA cm-2 and a Tafel slope of 46.4 mV per decade in 1.0 M KOH, which outperforms Pt/C catalyst (621 mV and 74.7 mV per decade). Density functional theory calculations illustrate the electron transfer from Co3Mo to CoMoO3 at the interfaces, where electron accumulation on CoMoO3 favors the dissociation of H2O molecule, and electron-deficient Co atoms in Co3Mo have optimized H* absorption energy for HER. The Co3Mo/CoMoO3 NPSs also exhibit higher oxygen evolution reaction activity than the RuO2 catalyst. Moreover, the water electrolyzer using Co3Mo/CoMoO3 NPSs as both cathode and anode only requires 1.59 V to deliver a current density of 100 mA cm-2 in 1.0 M KOH, which outperforms benchmark Pt/C || RuO2 electrodes couple with 1.69 V to reach the same current density, providing great potential for large-scale applications.",Journal of Materials Science and Technology
Tellurium intervened Fe-N codoped carbon for improved oxygen reduction reaction and high-performance Zn-air batteries,"© 2022Pyrolysis-acquired iron and nitrogen codoped carbon (Fe-N-C) has been comprehensively investigated for its promising oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalytic performance and structural complexity. The modification of non-metal elements with larger atomic radius and the corresponding intrinsic microstructure-property relations are rarely reported. In this study, tellurium (Te) intervened Fe-N-C was prepared by micelles-induced polymerization with Te nanowires as an in-situ intervening agent. The out-plane bonding of Te with Fe induced the increase of both N content and proportion of pyridinic N on the material surface, thus improving the ORR catalytic performance. The assembled Zn-air battery demonstrated a maximum power density of 250 mW/cm2 and excellent rate capability under various discharge current densities, which was much better than the Pt/C. Overall, the current work demonstrates a novel Te/Fe-N-C material and reveals an original Te intervened Fe-N-C strategy and N reconfiguration mechanism, which is of great significance for the design of key materials in energy-related fields.",Journal of Materials Science and Technology
Self-supported porous copper oxide nanosheet arrays for efficient and selective electrochemical conversion of nitrate ions to nitrogen gas,"© 2022Electrochemical techniques have shown advantages for the removal of low-concentration nitrate. Here, copper oxide nanosheets were grown on self-supporting nickel foam (NF) to prepare electrodes (CuO/NF), which realized the rapid and highly selective conversion of nitrate pollutants in sewage into nontoxic and harmless N2. The CuO/NF afforded 100% NO3– removal within 100 min and 99.53% selectivity for N2 at –50 mA without producing a lot of by-products (NO2–, NH4+, and N2H4). Furthermore, 81.8% of NO3– was removed under the given conditions after six experimental repetitions. These results suggest that the catalyst has excellent electrochemical stability. The performance of CuO/NF for the electrocatalytic removal of NO3– in simulated wastewater (which contained Cl– and SO42–) was almost unaffected. Because of the high efficiency, high stability, and low cost of CuO/NF, this catalyst is practical for the removal of nitrate for wastewater purification.",Journal of Materials Science and Technology
Fe3C@C/C for catalytic ozonation of silicon-containing wastewater: Dual improvement of silicon resistance and catalytic effect,"© 2022The improvement of catalysts’ stability under harsh reaction conditions is vital for their practical applicability. Herein, iron carbide (Fe3C) nanoparticles were encapsulated in graphitic carbon in situ and a carbon ball served as the carrier. The synthesized Fe3C@C/C was first utilized to treat an m-cresol wastewater containing Si via catalytic ozonation. Compared with the commercial Fe/Al2O3 catalyst, the resistance to Si of the Fe3C@C/C was improved 22.68 times, while the TOC removal rate increased by a factor of 2.9, and it remained stable during 10 cycles and 12000 min of continuous reaction, which further demonstrated its potential for diverse applications. The catalyst exhibits improved resistance to Si because of the dual protection from the carbon-encapsulated structure and carbon carrier. Density functional theory calculations show that the encapsulation of Fe3C using carbon significantly increases the resistance to adsorption of Si on its active sites. In addition, the activation of O3 is unimpeded on the Fe3C adsorption sites by the protection from C, thus the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by ozone is largely promoted. The mechanism associated with the resistance of the Fe3C@C/C catalyst to Si and its elevated activity are also elucidated.",Journal of Materials Science and Technology
Caterpillar-like 3D graphene nanoscrolls@CNTs hybrids decorated with Co-doped MoSe2 nanosheets for electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution,"© 2022Hydrogen is a clean and flexible energy carrier that has the promising to satisfy urgent demands of the energy crisis and environmental protection. Electrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), a critical half-reaction in water splitting, is one of the greenest and most common methods to obtain high-purity hydrogen. Designing preeminent activity and stability electrocatalysts for hydrogen precipitation reaction (HER) to reduce energy consumption is of great essential. 3D carbon-based materials have attracted widespread concern as the potential scaffolds of highly active and durable electrocatalysts for HER. To boost the HER activity and prolong the lifespan of electrocatalysts, multifarious 3D carbon architectures make an appearance to be engineered for accelerating electronic/mass transfer and maximizing the exposure of active sites. Herein, we designed and fabricated high-performance electrocatalysts based on a special caterpillar-like 3D graphene nanoscrolls@CNTs (GNS@CNTs) scaffold decorated with Co-doped MoSe2 nanosheets for HER. In the caterpillar-like hierarchical structure, CNTs were seamlessly co-bonded and dilated the interlayer and outer spacing of GNS through CVD growth technology, and nickel nanoparticles were covered by the CNTs tips. Taking advantage of the plentiful hierarchical pore, larger specific surface area, and higher chemical stability of the caterpillar-like structure, the catalysts exhibited enhanced electrocatalytic properties than some existing data reported. Density functional theory calculations showed that the encapsulated nickel nanoparticle could tune the electronic structure of the outer anchored Co-doped MoSe2 and optimize its ∆G of H* adsorption by electron traversing effect and doping effect. These indicate that caterpillar-like GNS@CNT is an ideal scaffold for anchoring actives substance and is suitable for high-efficient HER. This study provides new insights for designing hierarchical carbon composite nanostructures for catalysts, sensors, energy materials, and other applications.",Journal of Materials Science and Technology
Ultralow Fe doping induced high photocatalytic activity toward ciprofloxacin degradation and CO2 reduction,"© 2022TiO2 is one of the most ideal photocatalytic materials, but its application is limited by many problems (e.g., wide band gap, easy carrier recombination). Co-catalyst with changes in valence could efficiently overcome the disadvantages above. Herein, a Fe species (Fe, Fe2O3)/TiO2 was designed to fully utilize photogenerated charges and holes. The degradation rate of ciprofloxacin can reach 99.97%. In addition, its methane generation from photoreduction of CO2 is 12.9 times than that of pure TiO2. These results are attributed to the well-designed catalyst including the combination of TiO2 and FeOx as photocatalysts and oxygen buffers, and the dispersion of single-atom Fe clusters as cocatalysts and electron trap sites. The effect mechanism of Fe species on TiO2 was verified by PBE DFT calculation. Finally, following a concept of thermodynamic-kinetic synergy, a new design strategy for photocatalysts is accordingly proposed, as such, the prepared catalyst is expected to be applied in the environmental remediation.",Journal of Molecular Structure
Activation of oxalic acid via dual-pathway over single-atom Fe catalysts: Mechanism and membrane application,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Oxalic acid (OA), together with its ligand, appears in diverse biotic and abiotic processes in nature. However, the applications of the photochemical property of OA and its complexes in environmental purification are scarce. Herein, we reported a Fe single-atom catalyst with Fe-N4 configuration supported on g-C3N4 (Fe-CN) to activate OA for ultrahigh-efficiency removal of Cr(VI) under visible light irradiation through dual pathways: the photo-dissociation of [FeⅢ(C2O4)]+ and the reaction between OA and photogenerated holes, achieving the generation of •CO2-. The introduction of Fe-N4 favors the formation of configuration [FeⅢ(C2O4)]+ and fabricates the electron transfer channel from catalyst to OA, further decreases the energy barriers of •CO2- generation, and thereafter efficiently facilitates the C-C cleavage for the generate of •CO2-. Meanwhile, the strong coordination interaction over Fe single atoms and N atoms could enhance the separation efficiency of photo-carriers and further promote the reduction activity. Under optimal conditions, Fe-CN showed a 5.1-fold increasement in photocatalytic kinetics contrast to pristine CN. The Fe-CN catalyst attached on fibrous membrane for treatment of flowing Cr(VI) wastewater exhibits 90% reduction efficiency over 10 h, which is expected to facilitate the practical application of the catalyst. The mechanism of OA activation with dual-pathway was unveiled by in-situ Fourier transform infrared spectra and theoretical calculations. This work provides an important guidance for the application of OA and its complexes to achieve the attenuation of toxic and harmful heavy metal in water restoration.",Applied Catalysis B: Environmental
In-situ growth of Co/Zn bimetallic MOF on GO surface to prepare GO supporting Co@C single-atom catalyst for Hg0 oxidation,"© 2022Oxidation of Hg0 to Hg2+ is an efficient way to remove Hg0 from flue gas. Chemisorbed oxygen as the main active site plays an important role in Hg0 oxidation process. Single-atom catalyst has an excellent ability of transforming gaseous oxygen into chemisorbed oxygen. In the present work, graphene oxide (GO) was used as support to in-situ grow Co/Zn bimetallic MOF on GO surface. After pyrolysis, a GO supported Co@C single-atom catalyst was obtained. SEM and TEM results show that GO supporting gives a high dispersion for calcined MOF particles. HAADF-STEM results prove that most of the Co atoms in calcined MOF particles stay as single-atom status. EXAFS indicated that the Co atoms in the catalyst was coordinated with N, and the coordination was dominated by CoN2. CoN2 can capture and activate gaseous oxygen forming more chemisorbed oxygen. Thanks to the high dispersion of calcined MOF and higher chemisorbed oxygen concentration, the Hg0 oxidation efficiency of the obtained catalyst (Co2.5-SAs@NC/GO-1) can reach above 90 % in the temperature range of 120–180 °C with 0.075 g loading amount at the GHSV of 180, 000 h−1. The probable reaction pathway was analyzed by an adsorption–desorption experiment and XPS over the used and regenerated Co2.5-SAs@NC/GO-1.",Fuel

This work reports a vertical-aligned electrocatalyst of Cu2O/CoCu-LDH inlaid bilayer nanosheets that achieve excellent alkaline HER performance with a low overpotential of 96 mV at 10 mA cm−2 and a low Tafel slope of 76.8 mV dec−1. Notably, Cu2O/CoCu-LDH outperforms Pt/C at a practical current density of 600 mA cm−2. The structural characterizations and theory calculations revealed that the superior HER activity of Cu2O/CoCu-LDH is due to the distinctive morphology, optimized electronic structure and accelerated water dissociation kinetics. Remarkably, the Cu2O/CoCu-LDH acted as the cathode in alkaline Zn-H2O cell demonstrating the potential applications for H2 generation and electricity energy simultaneously. Our work can guide the design of LDH-based electrocatalysts with outstanding HER performance.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Manipulation of the CO2 capture capability of graphdiyne using transition metal decoration and charge injection: A DFT-D2 study,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdDue to the importance of removing pollutant gases from the environment, we are looking to introduce a new platform that has high performance. Here, we investigate the ability of the pristine and 3d transition metal (TM) decorated graphdiyne (GDY) surface for CO2 capturing with and without charge injection using DFT-D2 method. The results show that in the most stable configurations, TM is adsorbed in A2 site of the GDY for Ti to Cu metals, while Sc is placed in A3 site. Also, the highest binding energy is related to the Sc atom (-4.942 eV). The adsorption energies (Eads) of CO2 onto TMs-decorated GDY in the most stable configurations show that the highest adsorption energies are related to Sc to Cr-GDY (−0.650, −0.799, −1.404, and −0.581 eV, respectively), with improving about 3 to 7 times compared to the pristine GDY. Injection of the negative charge on the Sc-GDY structure shows that Eads of CO2 increases up to three times. Moreover, CO2 adsorption/ desorption can be controlled through the charge on–off switching process. Also, the CO2 capture capacity on the pristine GDY (PGDY) is 37.9 wt%, and it can increase to 70.2 wt% on the −3e charged Sc-GDY structure.",Fuel
Iodine-doped single-atom cobalt catalysts with boosted antioxidant enzyme-like activity for colitis therapy,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Doping with heteroatoms was performed as an effective strategy for modulating the electronic structure of single metal atom and further enhancing the catalytic activity of single-atom catalysts (SACs). Single-atom cobalt catalysts anchored on nitrogen-doped carbon (CoCN) have achieved considerable attention in biosensors and anti-inflammation therapy. How to further improve the antioxidant activity of CoCN for satisfying their biomedical applications is a hot topic. Here, we synthesized a series of halogen-doped CoCN, obtained CoCNF, CoCNCl, CoCNBr and CoCNI. We found the catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) -like catalytic activities of CoCNCl, CoCNBr and CoCNI significantly increased than that of CoCN. Especially, CoCNI exhibited the highest antioxidant capacity. Finally, we used CoCNI as the remarkable reactive oxygen species (ROS) eliminating material in protecting cellular against oxidase stress in vitro and colitis therapy in vivo. Our work opens a new insight to design SACs with high catalytic activities by halogen doping for ROS-relative disease therapy.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Ru monolayer island doped MoS2 catalysts for efficient hydrogen evolution reaction,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Developing highly-efficient hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalysts is significantly important for hydrogen generation by water splitting. In this work, Ru monolayer islands (MIs)-doped MoS2 catalysts are synthesized controllably by high-gravity technology. Ru MIs are successfully anchored on the MoS2 nanosheets via the coordination of Ru and S species in the MoS2 matrix to form monolayer island structure, which not only provides high-density active centers for boosting the HER activity, but also exhibits the maximum atomic utilization. The prepared Ru MIs-doped MoS2 catalysts exhibit a remarkably low overpotential of 17 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm−2 (η10) in alkaline conditions. Density functional theory (DFT) results reveal that multi-Ru monolayer doping can efficiently tailor the electronic structure and improve the adsorption of hydrogen on MoS2, and thereby boost the catalytic activity of HER. This work provides a Ru MIs doping approach to enhance the density of active sites of electrocatalysts, which would overcome the bottleneck of low active site density of single-atom catalysts to design high-efficient electrocatalysts with maximum atomic utilization.",Chemical Engineering Journal
"A review on S-scheme and dual S-scheme heterojunctions for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution, water detoxification and CO2 reduction","© 2022 Elsevier LtdDiscovering alternative materials and technologies that provide the meaningful potential to environmental and energy-related challenges in critical to the long-term viability of industrial activity and the evolution of society. Photocatalysts are undeniably important, and scientists are working hard to improve their photocatalytic performance. The high recombination rates of photogenerated electron-hole pairs as well as poor redox capability are addressed via heterojunction modification. In this direction, oxidation type and reduction type photocatalysts based S-scheme heterojunctions are highly promising owing to highly diminished recombination facilitated by internal electric field. This review has focused on the shift from Z-scheme to new revolutionary S-scheme based photocatalytic materials with high performance applications in the field of energy and environment. It can be concluded that controllable built-in electric field intensity and stable interfacial carrier transport process make S-scheme heterostrctures ideal. However their application is mainly limited to powder photocatalysts, don't apply to photo-chemistry and solar cells with external circuit, reaction thermodynamics and dynamics management in S-scheme photocatalysts is not adequate. To some extent, dual S-schemes address to these limitations and further research is to be carried out to fight the bottlenecks. Several perspectives on the future of S-scheme and dual S-scheme heterostructure were also provided based on rigorous review of the reported results. A discussion on the previously reported different types of heterojunctions and S-schemes is presented in this review along with plausible charge transfer mechanisms. The synthetic routes to S-scheme heterojunctions are also provided along with modifications and combinations. The current designing and perspective applications in numerous pollutant degradation, hydrogen production and CO2 conversion is selectively highlighted. The transition of mechanism elucidation from Z-scheme to S-scheme has been discussed with suitable case studies. However, S-scheme heterojunctions designing and fabrication is still new commercially and so present readiness and bottlenecks have been discussed. Hence it is quite imperative for a future roadmap to be laid to design and develop economically viable high performance S-scheme heterojunctions.",Fuel
Electron deficient boron-doped amorphous carbon nitride to uphill N2 photo-fixation through π back donation,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.The photocatalytic Nitrogen fixation to NH3 by using water as a protonation source is a requisite renovation for life. Albeit, the activation and adsorption of robust N[tbnd]N is the bottleneck in NH3 synthesis. Here, we report an amorphous-wrinkled hollow-tubular electron-deficient boron-doped carbon nitride (BCN) for improved photocatalytic N2 fixation via “σ donation and π back donation”. The electron-deficient B played synergetic roles to activate and stabilize the adsorbed N2 i.e. (i) It tunes the bandgap of CN for effective light absorption and charge transfer; (ii) The B-N coordination site polarizes chemisorbed N2 via electron pair acceptance; (iii) The filled sp2 orbital of B activates the N2 by π-back donation. Consequently, the photocatalytic performance of BCN-4 reaches 0.93mmolh−1g−1 with AQY of ∼13% (350 nm) and solar to NH3 conversion efficiency (SSCNH3) of 0.017%. The in situ DRIFT and DFT studies revealed that BCN exhibited spontaneous N2 adsorption and activation, followed by protonation of the adsorbed N2, with a negligible energy barrier.",Applied Catalysis B: Environmental
Potential-dependent reconstruction of Ni-based cuboid arrays for highly efficient hydrogen evolution coupled with electro-oxidation of organic compound,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.In-situ surface self-reconstruction of electrocatalysts plays a crucial role in efficiently catalyzing the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the organic compound oxidation reaction. Herein, a core@shell structure of metallic Ni@O-riched Ni layer (Ni@O-Ni) pre-electrocatalyst was established, which possesses a unique self-adaptable ability for the potential-dependent reconstruction to generate actual active sites for catalytic reactions. The reconstructed Ni@Ni/NiOx during the cathodic activation process shows an outstanding HER activity with a low overpotential of 71 mV to reach 10 mA cm−2 and remarkable stability in 1.0 M KOH. In addition, the core@shell structured Ni@NiOx during the anodic activation process contributes to abundant redox reactions for the electro-oxidation of organic compound. Especially, the Ni@NiOx exhibits an ultralow potential of 1.309 V at 10 mA cm−2 and ∼ 99 % yield of benzoic acid (Ph-COOH) product for the electro-oxidation of benzyl alcohol (Ph-CH2OH). In-situ Raman spectra corroborate the reversible transformation of Ni2+-Ox and γ-Ni3+–OOH and reveal the vital role of γ-Ni3+–OOH in seizing the proton for Ph-CH2OH electro-oxidation reaction. Moreover, the constructed integrated water splitting coupled with Ph-CH2OH electro-oxidation needs only a cell voltage of 1.438 V at 10 mA cm−2, resulting in an electrical energy saving of 14.3 % compared to overall water splitting. This work proposes profound insights into the correlation between surface features, potential-dependent reconstruction, and the multifunctionality of electrocatalysts.",Chemical Engineering Journal
"Controllable chemical composition in double-perovskite Bi0.5Sm0.5FeO3 epitaxial thin films for ferroelectric, photovoltaic, and ferromagnetic properties","© 2022 Elsevier B.V.The oxide double-perovskite thin films are promising multifunctional materials due to the coupled ferroic order parameters. However, the centrosymmetry of crystal structure limits its coupled multiferroic order. The regulation of chemical composition and crystal structure for double-perovskite thin films remains a research necessity. Here we first prepared the stable multifunctional multiferroic the Bi0.5Sm0.5FeO3 (BSFO) double-perovskite epitaxial thin films with Bi/Sm ratio closed to 1 on (0 0 1) LaAlO3 substrate. The chemical composition of BSFO thin films is regulated by changing the deposition temperature for adjusting the element competition between Bi and Sm. The evidence is provided that the BSFO double-perovskite thin films are constituted by pseudo-cubic perovskite subcell by the synchrotron-based X-ray diffraction and X-ray absorption spectroscopy. The BSFO double-perovskite thin films have robust ferroelectric polarization (∼0.67 μC/cm2), compared to that of rare-earth ferrites systems, which is stable after 108 cycles of switching. The ferroelectric origin of the BSFO double-perovskite thin films is considered to be the substrate strain and the ions substitution leading to the distorted pseudo-cubic structure. The difference in the light and dark current indicates excellent photoresponse of the BSFO double-perovskite thin films. The open-circuit voltage and short-circuit current can be enhanced to 0.325 V and −14.844 μA/cm2 with the polarization state, respectively, nearly twice as large as the nonpolarized ones. The possibility of ferroelectric storage is provided by the switchable ferroelectric photovoltaic feature, this process is non-destructive. The presence of Fe2+ ions and defect states in BSFO thin films weaken its antiferromagnetic coupling, leading to the enhanced ferromagnetic property. The double-perovskite design approach can be used to regulate the multifunctional properties of thin films.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Dual metal-organic frameworks-derived Fe-atomic sites bounded to fine Fe/FexC nanoparticles for enhanced oxygen electroreduction,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Maximizing metal utilization and increasing their activity are the main challenges to improve the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) performance of iron and nitrogen co-doped carbons (Fe-N-Cs) catalysts. However, the activity contribution of the iron-containing nanoparticles (i.e. Fe/FexC NPs) inevitably formed during the preparation of Fe-N-C catalysts is often overlooked. Herein, we develop a new composite electrocatalyst (Fe/FexC@Fe-N-Cs) via a surfactant-assisted “MOF-on-MOF” oriented assembly and confined conversion strategy to enhance Fe utilization. The resultant Fe/FexC@Fe-N-C-900, featuring the combination of fine Fe/FexC NPs and Fe-N4 reactive sites, achieves excellent ORR activity with half-wave potentials (E1/2) of 0.91 V and 0.81 V in both alkaline and acidic electrolytes. When using as the cathode, Fe/FexC@Fe-N-C-900 exhibits promising performances in Zn-air battery and H2-O2 fuel cell, featuring the maximum power density of 150 mW cm−2 and 560 mW cm−2, respectively. The electronic migration from Fe/FexC NPs to neighboring Fe-N4 sites leads to moderate adsorption for reactants/intermediates on Fe atomic centers, subsequently elevating optimal ORR performance, which is revealed by density functional theory (DFT) calculations, confirming the crucial effect of Fe/FexC NPs in improving the activity and stability of Fe-N-Cs.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Effect of the interfacial electronic coupling of nickel-iron sulfide nanosheets with layer Ti3C2 MXenes as efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts for anion-exchange membrane water electrolysis,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.In this study, nickel-iron sulfide (NiFeS) nanosheets were immobilized on Ti3C2 MXene-decorated nickel foam (Ti3C2 MXene/NF) by hydrothermal reaction (NiFeS@Ti3C2 MXene/NF). The morphology of NiFeS and interactions with Ti3C2 MXene resulted in electronic coupling that optimized the adsorption energies of water, protons, and oxygen atom for the HER (180 mV@20 mA cm-2) and OER (290 mV@20 mA cm-2). The NiFeS@Ti3C2 MXene/NF catalyst showed good water splitting performance in an alkaline membrane water electrolyzer, yielding a current density (j) of 401 mA cm-2 at 1.85 V with 67.65 % cell efficiency, performance comparable to Pt/C||RuO2 cells. From a commercial point of view, our electrolyzers are the best because of their low loading of catalysts (ca. 1.25 mg cm-2) and low operating temperatures (50 °C), resulting in low capital and operating costs. Our findings will aid the development of commercial green hydrogen production and offers an alternative to PEMWE.",Applied Catalysis B: Environmental
Boosting wastewater bioelectricity recovery via solvent mediation and zinc fencing: Dual regulation for catalyst spatial structure and active sites,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Bioelectrochemical systems (BESs) are promising in self-sustaining energy recovery of wastewater. Cathode catalysts are crucial to enhancing the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) process in BESs. In this study, a dual regulation strategy including solvent mediation and zinc fencing was proposed for regulation of catalyst spatial structure and active sites. The particle size of catalysts derived from bimetallic zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) was tuned over a wide range via solvent mediation while the dispersion of cobalt active sites was achieved via zinc fencing. As-optimized cobalt active sites embedded nitrogen-doped porous carbon with a Co/Zn molar ratio of 1/20 (Co1/20@NPC) directed a four-electron transfer pathway in ORR process. The BES employing Co1/20@NPC as cathode catalyst produced a maximum power density of 2057 ± 21 mW m−2, 40% higher than the BES using Pt/C as cathode catalyst. Co1/20@NPC BES displayed fast organic elimination and efficient energy recovery with a coulombic efficiency of 73 ± 1% and a normalized energy recovery of 0.361 ± 0.006 kWh m−3. The outstanding ORR activity, high bioelectricity generation and operation stability made Co1/20@NPC a prospective cathode catalyst. This dual regulation strategy provides implications for controllable synthesis of ZIF-derived catalysts with tailored structures and characteristics, and demonstrates potential in improving wastewater energy recovery performance in BESs.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Fabricated noble-metal free Co2B/g-C3N4 photocatalyst with 2D/2D structure achieved remarkable water splitting performance from visible to near-infrared wavelengths,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdDeveloping noble-metal-free photocatalysts to address the challenges of high recombination rate of electrons and holes and poor optical response is high desirable for water splitting. Herein, cobalt boride (Co2B) nanosheets with amorphous phases ordered in short-range but disordered in long-range was fabricated, and coupled with graphic carbon nitride (CN) photocatalysts in the form of B(δ−)–Co(δ+)–N(δ−) bonding states through an in-situ chemical reduction method. The optimized Co2B/CN nanohybrids exhibited a H2 evolution rate of 56.86 μmol/h with the highest AQY up to 22.8 %, outperforming than that of Pt decorated CN. Theoretical calculation by DFT verify the characterization results and show that Co active sites on Co2B have better performance of adsorbing H atoms and desorbing hydrogen. The disordered structure of Co2B nanosheets contributed to water splitting performance by providing abundant active sites while metallic nature of Co2B facilitated electrons transfer and inhibited the recombination of electrons and holes. Moreover, theoretical calculation suggested that the high concentration of free carriers endowed Co2B with an resembled SPR effect, thereby increasing the light response of CN and triggering the reaction from visible-light region extended to the near-infrared region up to 800 nm.",Fuel
Laser-assisted rapid synthesis of anatase/rutile TiO2 heterojunction with Function-specified micro-zones for the effective photo-oxidation of sulfamethoxazole,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.A solid-state laser scanning treatment (SLST) was adopted to synthesize anatase/rutile TiO2 heterojunction with effective charge carrier separation and high surface adsorption performances for the photodegradation of sulfamethoxazole (SMX). The 1064 nm pulsed fiber laser could in-situ generate rutile zones on the pristine sheet-like anatase crystal enclosed by (0 0 1) facets, which could form the well-defined anatase/rutile interface to promote the formation of dominating active species (h+ and ∙OH) on the anatase zones. X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) measurements, low temperature electron paramagnetic resonance (LT-EPR) as well as the density functional theory (DFT) simulation proved that the oxygen vacancies (VO) could both introduce defective energy states to promote the light absorption and enhance the SMX adsorption on anatase zones. Based on the delicately designed micro-zones, the photodegradation efficiency of the optimized catalyst could reach 99.3 %, which demonstrated ∼7 times higher performance than that of pristine TiO2 and exhibited robust stability under environmental conditions. Gaussian and Vienna Ab Initio Package (VASP) programs were used to provide detailed degradation pathways and mechanism for SMX. This SLST could be potentially employed to create function-specified zones on various catalysts for different applicational aims.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Efficient electrochemical CO2 reduction to CO by metal and nitrogen co-doped carbon catalysts derived from pharmaceutical wastes adsorbed on commercial carbon nanotubes,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Transition metal and nitrogen doped carbon catalysts (M[sbnd]N[sbnd]C) are effective in electrochemical reduction of CO2 to CO with a high selectivity. However, scalable and cost-effective synthesis of active metal-nitrogen catalysts is yet to be developed. Herein, we report a simple and sustainable method that utilizes commercial carbon nanotubes (CNTs) to adsorb a pharmaceutical waste, sulfamethoxazole (SMX), followed by moderate pyrolysis to prepare an efficient M[sbnd]N[sbnd]C catalyst. The intrinsic metal impurities from CNTs are essential to form active metal sites, and it requires significantly less nitrogen precursor than methods using most widely nitrogen precursors such as melamine and urea. The CNT-SMX catalyst delivers high CO2RR performance with 91.5 % CO Faradaic efficiency and 14 mA/cm2 CO partial current density at −0.76 V vs RHE in a traditional H-Cell. The catalyst is also efficient in a scalable flow cell, exhibiting 97.5 % CO selectivity at 300 mA/cm2, plus stable CO2RR performance for more than 24 h at 100 mA/cm2. The scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) analyses confirm the existence of single atomic sites primarily in the form of Fe-N bonds that are active sites for CO2RR. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggest a synergy between the single atomic Fe[sbnd]N[sbnd]C sites and Ni nanoparticles embedded in the CNTs, which enhances CO production rate and selectivity by lowering the desorption energy of *CO intermediate. To the best of our knowledge, the results in this work are among the top performing carbon-based catalysts. Furthermore, catalysts developed in this work are synthesized at a moderate temperature without pre-oxidation or post-acid-washing and utilize cheap or waste materials, presenting a simple, sustainable, and cost-effective way to synthesize highly active catalysts.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Unraveling the hierarchical porous structure in natural pollen-derived Fe-containing carbon to address the shuttle effect and dead sulfur problems in lithium-sulfur batteries,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Mesoporous carbon–metal composites with the merits of strong adsorption ability over soluble lithium polysulfides (LiPSs), excellent sulfur dispersion, high conductivity, low cost, and rapid catalytic conversion rate to suppress the shuttle effect are promising in lithium-sulfur batteries. However, their application is usually limited by structural collapse and fast fading because of the poorly dispersed metal-based compounds in the mesoporous carbon host during high-temperature synthesis. Herein, a 3D rape pollen-derived carbon (RPDC) containing Fe-based compounds as the sulfur host is prepared through the solid-state reaction of simultaneous carbonization between natural rape pollen and ferrous oxalate. Characterizations confirm that Fe-RPDC composites have stronger physiochemical adsorption and catalytic ability than pure RPDC, Fe-doped commercial activated carbon, and pure Fe3O4. Then, soluble LiPSs are adsorbed, fixed on the surface of the Fe-RPDC composites and catalyzed by Fe-based compounds to reduce the “dead sulfur”. Finally, a mature natural structure-derived hollow carbon-iron compound system is developed. The lithium-sulfur battery assembled using Fe-RPDC as host showed excellent long-term stability and a high electron transport rate. The Fe-RPDC@S composite with 69.6 wt% sulfur content exhibits the highest initial discharge capacity of 955.7 mA h g−1 at a rate of 1 C and can be maintained at 556.3 mA h g−1 even after 150 cycles. The decay rate is only 0.03 % per cycle, and the average Coulomb efficiency is approximately 98 %. Hence, the reasonable design of Fe-RPDC composites is of great significance for promoting the transformation of polysulfide intermediates and chemically anchoring soluble LiPSs to restrain “dead sulfur” and can be used to realize low-cost, green and large-scale production.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Membrane-free pure H2 production over single dispersed Ru-anchored Pt3Ni alloys via coupling ethanol selective electrooxidation,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.The sluggish kinetics and high overpotential of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at anode hinders water splitting large-scale application. Recently, an anode alternative strategy exhibits promising prospect of application to improve reaction kinetics and decrease overpotential. Here, single dispersed Ru-anchored porous Pt3Ni alloy (Ru1-Pt3Ni/NiF) were successfully synthesized via spontaneous galvanic reduction, over which highly selective electrooxidation of ethanol into acetate was realized. DFT calculations show that Ru modification introduced abundant active oxygen species (OH*), which not only enhanced the oxidation activity of ethanol, but also increased the selectivity for C2 oxidation pathway. Then a Ru1-Pt3Ni/NiF||Pt3Ni/NiF ethanol oxidation membrane-free cell was built to couple the ethanol electrooxidation with H2 evolution, where the Faraday efficiency of H2 production reaches 94% and the power consumption is 19.24 kWh kgH2−1. This work provides a cost-competitive and energy-saving strategy for high-purity H2 generation, opening new opportunities for electric energy utilization from renewable sources.",Applied Catalysis B: Environmental
Photoinduced acceleration of Fe3+/Fe2+ cycle in heterogeneous FeNi-MOFs to boost peroxodisulfate activation for organic pollutant degradation,"© 2022The sluggish regeneration rate of Fe2+ in Fe-based heterogeneous catalysts restricts their wider application in persulfate-based advanced oxidation process (PS-AOPs). To conquer such challenge, Fe-embedded Ni-based metal-organic frameworks (FeNi-MOFs) with heteroatomic metal nodes were prepared and employed for persulfate activation to construct highly efficient PS-AOPs. Spectral analyses and density functional theory (DFT) calculations elucidated that the ligand-to-metal charge transfer and polarization of adjacent Ni centers endowed accelerated Fe3+/Fe2+ redox cycle in the resultant FeNi-MOFs under light irradiation and thus promoted the Fe2+ recovery with Fe3+/Fe2+ cycling efficiency > 58%. Consequently, the FeNi-MOFs delivered remarkable performance in peroxodisulfate activation and higher specific activity than that of the control Ni-MOFs/Fe3+ and state-of-the-art catalysts reported to date. This study provides new avenue of the accelerating Fe3+/Fe2+ circulation in entirely heterogeneous systems for persulfate activation and also highlights the great potential of MOFs in design of high-performance Fe-based catalysts for PS-AOPs.",Applied Catalysis B: Environmental
In-situ self-templating construction of FeNi/N co-doped 3D porous carbon from bimetallic ions-coordinated porous organic polymer for rechargeable zinc-air batteries,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Herein, an in-situ self-templating approach is applied to construct FeNi/N co-doped 3D porous carbon from bimetallic (Fe/Ni) ions-coordinated porous organic polymer (denoted as OPOP-FeNi). The OPOP-FeNi precursor is synthesized by polycondensation of sodium benzene-1,3,5-tris(olate) with cyanuric chloride followed by coordination with Fe3+/Ni2+, in which the in-situ generated NaCl can serve as template for the construction of 3D-interconnected hierarchical porous architecture during the pyrolysis process. The as-constructed FeNi/N-C-800 can offer high electrocatalytic activities toward ORR/OER with a high half-wave potential of 0.845 V (vs. RHE) in ORR and a low potential of 1.600 V (vs. RHE) at 10 mA cm−2 in OER. The outstanding ORR/OER activities render FeNi/N-C-800-based rechargeable zinc-air battery (RZAB) with long cycling life (1500 cycles/1000 h at 5.0 mA cm−2), much more stable than previous reports on RZABs. Moreover, DFT calculations and poisoning experiments have been conducted to unveil the outstanding bifunctional activity of FeNi/N-C-800 electrocatalyst.",Applied Catalysis B: Environmental
Construction of hierarchical and self-supported NiFe-Pt3Ir electrode for hydrogen production with industrial current density,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Rational design and fabrication of electrocatalysts from the perspective of mass transfer and electronic structure is highly desirable for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, a hierarchical and self-supported electrode comprising Cu nanowires, NiFe nanosheets, and Pt3Ir alloy nanoparticles (Cu NWs@NiFe-Pt3Ir) was in situ constructed and established as a highly active and robust electrocatalyst for HER with industrial current densities. Benefiting from the hierarchical structure, abundant active sites, and positive electronic interaction between NiFe and Pt3Ir, the Cu NWs@NiFe-Pt3Ir electrode shows extremely low overpotentials of 210 and 239 mV to reach industrial current densities of 500 and 1000 mA cm−2 in 1.0 M KOH solution, respectively. More importantly, Cu NWs@NiFe-Pt3Ir electrode shows robust durability with a slight increment of 8 mV for the required potential after consecutive tests for 7 days under 500 mA cm−2. As further revealed by electrochemical and theoretical studies, the reaction kinetics of NiFe is greatly promoted by coupling with Pt3Ir, and the d-band center energy level of Pt 5d orbital is lowered by Ir atom, which not only facilitates the electron consumption at the electrode/electrolyte interface but also optimizes the energies for H adsorption and H2 desorption. This work provides valuable insights into the construction of self-supported electrodes with extraordinary activity and durability for industrial applications.",Applied Catalysis B: Environmental
Single atom cobalt catalyst derived from co-pyrolysis of vitamin B12 and graphitic carbon nitride for PMS activation to degrade emerging pollutants,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.This study prepared the carbon-supported cobalt catalyst (Co-C-X) for activating peroxymonosulfate (PMS), and investigated the effect of co-pyrolysis temperature of graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) and vitamin B12 on the catalytic activity. It was found that with the increase of co-pyrolysis temperature, the catalytic activity of Co-C-X increased, due to the different coordination structures of cobalt. At 500 °C (Co-C-500), cobalt existed as CoO; while it was single atom Co at 600 °C (Co-C-600); and small size CoO at 700 °C (Co-C-700). Co-C-X could activate PMS to produce hydroxyl radicals, sulfate radicals, high-valent cobalt-oxo and singlet oxygen, which depended on the pyrolysis temperature. Although Co-C-700 had the highest catalytic activity, the leaching cobalt was also highest (3.23 mg/L), compared with that of Co-C-500 (0.27 mg/L) and Co-C-600 (0.14 mg/L). Co-C-600 had fast degradation for atrazine, nitrobenzene, bisphenol A, phenol and 4-chlorophenol, which also had wide pH range and high tolerance to inorganic ions.",Applied Catalysis B: Environmental
Integrating vacancy engineering and energy-level adapted coupling of electrocatalyst for enhancement of carbon dioxide conversion,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.CO2 activation capability and conductivity of electrocatalysts are two crucial factors to address the high activation barrier and slow kinetics of CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). Still, substantial promotion of both factors remains challenging. Herein, we report sulfur-deficient tin disulfide covered nitrogen-doped hollow carbon spheres (SnS2−x/NHCS) as electrocatalyst for CO2RR. Combining experimental analysis with calculations, we demonstrate that the S vacancies and energy-level adapted coupling can decrease the reaction barrier, increase the CO2 adsorption capacity and affinity with the intermediate, and promote the conductivity, delivering a current density of 35.3 mA cm−2 at − 1.2 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) and a Faradaic efficiency for formate > 80% in a large potential range from − 0.8 to − 1.2 V (vs. RHE). This work unravels the relationship of the vacancy engineering/hybrid coupling of SnS2−x/NHCS with its CO2RR performance, and proposes a convenient route to boost the CO2 activation capability and conductivity of electrocatalysts simultaneously.",Applied Catalysis B: Environmental
Well-controlled 3D flower-like CoP3/CeO2/C heterostructures as bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts for rechargeable Zn-air batteries,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Recently, transition metal phosphides (TMPs) have emerged as robust electrocatalysts for rechargeable Zn-air batteries, but their electrocatalytic performance needs further improvements. Herein, well-controlled 3D flower-like CoP3/CeO2/C heterostructures are developed via a pyrolysis-phosphorization strategy, with 3D CeO2 nanoflowers as promoters. The resultant CoP3/CeO2/C heterostructures exhibit high electrocatalytic activity in both oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Owing to the large specific surface area and enhanced electrical conductivity, the CoP3/CeO2/C-2 catalyst delivers a small overpotential (339.2 mV at 10 mA cm−2) for the OER and a high half-wave potential for the ORR, which are superior to its counterparts. More importantly, it also demonstrates robust stability in OER and ORR. The CoP3/CeO2/C-2-based rechargeable Zn-air battery yields large power density (150.0 mW cm−2), high energy density (871.3 Wh kgZn−1), and excellent cycling stability.",Applied Catalysis B: Environmental
Ultrafast degradation of emerging organic pollutants via activation of peroxymonosulfate over Fe3C/Fe@N-C-x: Singlet oxygen evolution and electron-transfer mechanisms,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Fe3C/Fe decorated N-doped magnetic carbon materials (denoted as Fe3C/Fe@N-C-x) were successfully fabricated via facile one-pot calcination of MIL-88B(Fe) with a green precursor of melamine. Benefiting from the co-existence of sp2-hybridized C–π moieties, oxygen-containing groups (C[dbnd]O and O–C[dbnd]O), N-doping species and ferreous nanoparticles (FNPs), the as-obtained Fe3C/Fe@N-C-9 exhibited excellent activation of peroxymonosulfate (PMS) for ultrafast elimination of various emerging organic contaminants with high mineralization capacities. Inspired by the unique nanotube morphology and encapsulation of FNPs, the Fe3C/Fe@N-C-9 possessed trace Fe leaching and can be magnetically separated for an easy recycling. Combining with competitive radical scavenging tests, electron spin resonance (ESR), electrochemical analysis and in-situ Raman spectra, the singlet oxygen (1O2) and electron-transfer can be accounted for the organic pollutant removal. Because of that, the Fe3C/Fe@N-C-9 exhibited good resistance to inorganic anions and natural organic matters (NOMs). It was fascinating that Fe3C/Fe@N-C-9 achieved satisfactory treatment efficiency for real pharmaceutical wastewater.",Applied Catalysis B: Environmental
Ultralight conductive IrO2 nanostructured textile enables highly efficient hydrogen and oxygen evolution reaction: Importance of catalyst layer sheet resistance,"© 2022 The AuthorsLarge-scale deployment of polymer electrolyte membrane water electrolysis, which is a promising technology for green hydrogen production, requires significant reduction of Ir in catalyst layer due to its high material cost. However, as the Ir amount in the catalyst layer decreases, number of electrically-isolated-inactive catalysts increases, resulting in poor performance. Here we show that the nanostructured textiles essentially avoids the formation of such inactive catalysts, enables unprecedented long-term hydrogen evolution with ultralow Ir mass loadings at high rates. We reveal that achieved high performance is derived from the low resistivity of prepared nanostructured textile which have a unique porous, three-dimensional structure. We also show that the nanostructured textiles facilitate simple catalyst-coated membrane production, which does not require liquid-phase processes or produce chemical waste. The method we developed can also be applied to a variety of zero-gap electrochemical conversion cells that require a high-rate catalytic reactions with small amounts of catalyst.",Applied Catalysis B: Environmental
Sulfur-induced electron redistribution of single molybdenum atoms promotes nitrogen electroreduction to ammonia,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) is considered a sustainable approach that endows NH3 production from N2 and H2O under ambient conditions. Due to the sluggish adsorption/activation of N2 and the strong competition with the hydrogen evolution reaction, advanced NRR electrocatalysts with both high activity and selectivity are required. Herein, we demonstrate a local modulation strategy that simultaneously promotes NRR selectivity and activity on molybdenum-based single atom catalysts (SACs) by sulfur-induced electronic redistribution, delivering a NH3 yield rate of 46.6 μg·h−1·mgcat−1 and a Faradaic efficiency of 28.9% at a potential of − 0.2 V vs. RHE in 0.1 M HCl under ambient conditions. This study provides a promising strategy for synergizing the selectivity and activity of electrocatalysts toward multistep NRR. Moreover, such an atomic-level engineering strategy should be applicable to other SACs in general and may have a major impact on their use in electrocatalytic applications.",Applied Catalysis B: Environmental
Ultra-high voltage efficiency rechargeable zinc-air battery based on high-performance structurally regulated metal-rich nickel phosphides and carbon hybrids bifunctional electrocatalysts,"© 2022Metal phosphides featuring electronic structure similar to Pt-group metal have triggered substantial concerns, and unveiling active species is crucial to rational design of bifunctional catalysts for ORR and OER. Herein, a hybrid of metal-rich nickel phosphides strongly coupled with heteroatom-doped carbon (NixP-NP-C) is constructed by a facile pyrolysis combined with in-situ phosphorization of MOFs. This unique hybrid exhibits superior electrocatalytic activity and stability toward ORR and OER demonstrated by delightful high Eonset and E1/2 up to 0.90 and 0.76 V, respectively, along with a long-term stability. The resulting zinc-air battery shows an impressively small charge-discharge voltage gap and delivers a high power density of 266 mW cm−2. The high catalytic performance of NixP-NP-C can be ascribed to synergistic effect of metal-rich Ni2P actives and heteroatoms doped porous carbon. Consequently, hybrid of carbon and metal phosphides may provide a meaningful reference for developing high performance oxygen catalysts in metal-air battery.",Applied Catalysis B: Environmental
Efficient CO2 photoreduction triggered by oxygen vacancies in ultrafine Bi5O7Br nanowires,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Sluggish charge kinetics, poor photoabsorption and low CO2 affinity have been regarded as the main obstacles inhibiting the efficiency of CO2 photoreduction. Herein, freestanding ultrafine Bi5O7Br nanowires with abundant oxygen vacancies were initially fabricated to synchronously optimize these critical processes. The 1D ultrafine configuration and abundant oxygen vacancies endow the Bi5O7Br nanowires with extended photoadsorption, boosted charge separation and enhanced interfacial CO2 adsorption and activation. Density functional calculations reveal that the presence of oxygen vacancies on the Bi5O7Br surface can not only afford abundant localized electrons and lower the CO2 reaction energy barriers, but also have a stronger covalent interaction and more efficient electron exchange and transfer between CO2 and oxygen vacancies. Without any co-catalyst or sacrifice reagent, OV-rich Bi5O7Br nanowires show a 27.76-fold enhancement of CO2 photoreduction activity relative to bulk Bi5O7Br in the gas-solid system. This work may inspire the future design of ultrafine catalysts for artiﬁcial photosynthesis.",Applied Catalysis B: Environmental
Combining quasi-ZIF-67 hybrid nanozyme and G-quadruplex/hemin DNAzyme for highly sensitive electrochemical sensing,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs), a famous subfamily of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), are considered promising electrocatalysts. Herein, ZIF-67 was selected as an electrocatalyst for designing electrochemical sensors due to having the best electrocatalytic activity in ZIFs. To overcome the insufficient electrocatalytic activity of ZIFs, ZIF-67 derivatives (QZIF-67-X, where X represents calcination time) were obtained by calcining at 250 °C for a certain time. The porous structure of the precursor in QZIF-67-X is maintained, exposing more active centers. QZIF-67-X could accelerate electron transfer and lead to improve the electrocatalytic performance. Moreover, QZIF-67-2 was chosen as an Au nanoparticle-supported nanocarrier to further bind G-quadruplex/hemin DNAzymes with strong catalytic activity due to the best supporting activity of QZIF-67-2 among QZIF-67-X. The synergistic catalysis of QZIF-67-2 and G-quadruplex/hemin DNAzymes effectively amplified the reduction current signal of H2O2. The linear range of the prepared electrochemical sensor was 2 μM-65 mM, and the detection limit was 1.2 μM. Moreover, the real-time detection of H2O2 from HepG2 cells was achieved by the sensor, providing a novel technique for efficient anticancer drug evaluation. These results suggested that QZIF-67 can be utilized as an efficient electrocatalyst for improving the sensitivity of sensors.",Bioelectrochemistry
Synergistic coupling of Ni3ZnC0.7 decorated with homogeneous multimetal CoNiCuFe nitrogen-codoped carbon matrix as high-entropy catalysts for efficient overall water splitting,"© 2022Due to unique electrical properties and high catalytic efficiency, transition metal nitrogen-codoped carbide (TM–N–C) has attracted tremendous interest as a multifunctional electrocatalyst for water splitting. Unlike traditional single-source modification, herein a novel pomegranate-like high-entropy (HE) electrocatalyst of Ni3ZnC0.7 decorated with homogeneous multimetal (Fe, Co, Cu, and Ni) nitrogen-codoped carbon matrix (Ni3ZnC0.7@CoNiCuFe–NC) is reported. It can be implemented by the simple thermal annealing method of multimetal codoped zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF). Benefiting from the synergistic effects of plentiful TM–N–C species, template effect of ZIF and distinct nanoporous structure, HE electrocatalyst Ni3ZnC0.7@CoNiCuFe–NC exhibits outstanding electrocatalytic performance. When applied in strong alkaline electrolyte (1.0 M KOH), the overpotentials of Ni3ZnC0.7@CoNiCuFe–NC present as low as 202 and 97 mV for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) at 10 mA cm−2 current density. Surprisingly as a bifunctional electrode, it can achieve the low cell voltage of 1.53 V at 10 mA cm−2 current density for overall water splitting, which is comparable to conventional IrO2||Pt/C electrode and superior to the recently reported analogous bifunctional catalysts. Thus, the work proposes the direction for the rational design of homogeneous distribution of TM–N–C material for water splitting in the green hydrogen energy industry.",Journal of Materials Science and Technology
Fe/N co-doped nano-TiO2 wrapped mesoporous carbon spheres for synergetically enhanced adsorption and photocatalysis,"© 2022Carbon-based adsorption and TiO2-based photocatalysis are both safe and low-cost ways of pollutant purification. Constructing C-TiO2 architectures can effectively improve removal efficiency. However, most of those carbon frames only acted as supporting substrates, exhibiting rather limited synergistic action from TiO2 and carbon. Herein, Fe/N co-doped nano-TiO2 wrapped on mesoporous carbon spheres with a core-shell structure was designed. The Fe, N co-doped carbon sphere with a hierarchical structure improved the synergy of adsorption and transfer during the photocatalytic process. Without extra dopant, the Fe and N partly exposed on the surface realized the in-situ migrating into the TiO2 shell to enhance the interface effect, which significantly promoted the photocatalytic efficiency of the composite. Furthermore, the photocatalytic efficiency of the composite was investigated through two typical pollutants under visible-light irradiation. The degradation efficiencies for rhodamine B and paraxylene were 96.2% in 60 min and 94.1% in 20 min, respectively, with the apparent rate constant of 0.045 min–1 and 0.049 min–1, 8.3 and 11.4 times of that for bare TiO2. The composite is likely advantageous for treating diverse environmental pollutants.",Journal of Materials Science and Technology
Constructing efficient ternary PtTeCu nano-catalysts with 2D ultrathin-sheet structures for oxidation reaction of alcohols,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Ternary Pt-based nanomaterials have arisen much interest due to their outstanding electro-catalytic performance to reactions in fuel cells as well as the decrease of the utilization of Pt atoms. The construction of two-dimensional (2D) ternary Pt-based nanocatalysts by combining the advantages of alloy and geometric structure were appealing. In this work, we prepared free-standing ultrathin and highly flexible PtTeCu nanosheets (NSs) by a one-pot polyol method. The ultrathin feature and nanopore structure at the edges allowed the exposure of a large number of Pt atoms, supplying sufficient active sites for the catalytic reaction. The obtained PtTeCu NSs exhibited significantly higher ethylene glycol oxidation reaction (EGOR) and methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) performance reaching mass activities of 7.1 A/mg and 4.9 A/mg, compared to 6.5 and 6.1 times that of commercial Pt/C, respectively. The freestanding PtTeCu NS were subjected to long-term stability tests (200 cycles) where activity decay and structural changes were negligible. DFT calculations showed that the introduction of Cu and Te into Pt resulted in a significant downward shift of the d-band center of Pt. This weakened the adsorption energy of the products on PtTeCu NSs and accelerated the desorption of the products to the catalyst surface, enhancing the catalyst activity and stability. The unique ultrathin nano-sheet structures could provide sufficient active sites for the catalytic reaction, which also contributed to the excellent catalytic performance.",Applied Surface Science
Triple-phase interfacial engineering Pt-CeO2-nitrogen-doped carbon electrocatalysts for proton exchange membrane fuel cells,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Improving the activity and durability of Pt electrocatalysts is an important pathway to reduce the dosage of precious Pt for proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). Herein, zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8) derived nitrogen-doped carbon (NC) supported Pt-CeO2 composites with abundant triple-phase interfacial conjunction are demonstrated. The CeO2 can modulate the electronic structure of Pt via electronic effects, thus modulating the energy of oxygen intermediates absorbed on Pt sites. Besides, the CeO2 also can stabilize the Pt nanoparticles by metal-support interactions. Therefore, the as-fabricated catalyst shows ultrahigh activity and durability towards oxygen reduction reaction. The half-wave potential is 0.922 V, and mass activity is 0.165 mA·ugPt−1 in 0.1 M HClO4. After 10, 000 cycles of accelerated durability tests (ADTs), the E1/2 decreases by only 10 mV. In addition, the 20% Pt/CeO2-NC (power density: 1.08 W·cm−2, cathode: 0.20 mgPt·cm−2) shows more excellent electrochemical activity and durability with lower cathode Pt loading than 20% commercial Pt/C (power density: 1.03 W·cm−2, cathode: 0.40 mgPt·cm−2) in PEMFC single cell measurements. This study provides a novel strategy for constructing a Pt-metal oxide-support triple-phase interface to improve the electrocatalytic performance of catalysts.",Applied Surface Science
Electrodeposition of shaped PtIr alloy nanocrystals with high–index facets for the electro–catalytic oxidation of alcohols,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Pt–group metal nanocatalysts enclosed with high–index facets have sufficient kink and step atoms on the surface, which could act as efficient sites for fuel cell reactions. Besides surface structure, alloying was another efficient strategy to obtain nanoparticles with excellent catalytic performance. So how about combining the surface structure of high–index facet with alloying to prepare Pt–based nanocatalysts? In this work, we have synthesized alloyed PtIr tetrahexahedral (THH) nanocrystals (NCs) with high–index facets (7 3 0) by electrodeposition. And PtIr trioctahedral (TOH) NCs with high–index facets (4 4 1) could be obtained by simply decreasing the upper limit potential (EU) of square–wave potential (SWP) with other condition keeping the same as that for the synthesis of PtIr THH NCs. The successful synthesis of alloyed PtIr NCs with high–index facets mainly lied in the repetitive adsorption/desorption of oxygenated species on the surface of nanoparticles. The prepared PtIr THH NCs exhibited excellent electrocatalytic activity and stability towards ethylene glycol oxidation reaction (EGOR) and glycerol oxidation reaction (GOR). Among the nano–catalysts, the peak in the forward scan of PtIr THH NCs for EGOR and GOR were 19.9 mA∙cm−2 and 17.6 mA∙cm−2, respectively, which were 9.5 and 6.8 times higher than those of commercial Pt/C. The excellent electro–catalytic performance of alloyed PtIr NCs could mainly be attributed to the surface structure effect of high–index facets and synergetic effect of the alloy structure. This work could provide a new idea for designing highly efficient nanocatalysts for fuel cells by combing surface structure effect and alloying effect together.",Applied Surface Science
Simultaneous catalytic oxidation mechanism of NO and Hg0 over single-atom iron catalyst,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Among the many pollutants emitted from coal-fired power plants, elemental mercury (Hg0) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) are widely concerned and regarded as a global environmental problem. Catalytic oxidation is an effective method to remove the above power plant pollutants. Although the recent pioneering experiment found that single-atom catalysts (SACs) exhibit excellent performance for the oxidation of NO and Hg0, the reaction mechanism for the simultaneous removal of NO and Hg0 has not been thoroughly revealed. In this work, a single-atom iron catalyst supported by a double vacancy doped graphene substrate with four N atoms (Fe1N4) was used to explore the reaction mechanism of O2 simultaneous catalytic of NO and Hg0. By using DFT method and energy span model, all possible paths of simultaneous catalytic oxidation of NO and Hg0 are enumerated. Among the ten paths we found, Termolecular Eley-Rideal (TER) mechanism has the lowest energy barrier. The rate determining reaction barrier is 1.59 eV. Disregarding the contribution of molecular collisions, TER path is more kinetically favorable for the integrated removal of NO and Hg0. Comprehensive consideration of intermolecular collisions, the catalytic oxidation reaction follows the E-R mechanism. The study deepened the understanding of the reaction mechanism of simultaneous removal of NO and Hg0.",Applied Surface Science
High-performance non-enzymatic glucose sensing on nanocomposite electrocatalysts of nickel phthalocyanine nanorods and nitrogen doped-reduced graphene oxide nanosheets,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Highly stable and efficient electrocatalytic materials are essential for developing high-performance non-enzymatic fourth-generation glucose biosensors. In this regard, hybrid materials incorporating metallophthalocyanines and carbon-based nanostructures are particularly interesting. A nanocomposite of nitrogen-doped reduced graphene oxide nanosheets and nickel phthalocyanine nanorods (N-rGONs|NiPcNRs) was prepared. N-rGONs|NiPcNRs were highly efficient and stable electrocatalysts for non-enzymatic D-glucose electrooxidation in alkaline media. Spectroscopic, microscopic, and electrochemical methods were used to characterize and evaluate the electrocatalytic performance of the N-rGONs|NiPcNRs. The remarkable electrocatalytic activity of N-rGONs|NiPcNRs originated from the in-situ transformation and formation of polymeric O-Ni-O oxo-bridge in alkaline electrolyte and the excellent electroconductivity of the N-rGONs. The N-rGONs|NiPcNRs with the optimum ratio of NiPcNRs to N-rGONs presented an efficient formation of the Ni-O-Ni oxo-bridge and D-glucose electrooxidation compared to N-rGONs and NiPcNRs alone. Thus, the fabricated GCE|N-rGONs|NiPcNRs glucose sensor showed an excellent analytical performance with a high sensitivity of 1458 µA.mM−1.cm−2 and a detection limit of 1.43 µM (S/N = 3) using cyclic voltammetry. For online glucose detection using chronoamperometry, a sensitivity of 358.9 µA.mM−1.cm−2 with a detection limit of 5.0 µM (the lowest concentration that could be discriminated from the buffer using GCE|N-rGONs|NiPcNRs) and a fast response time of 0.80 s was obtained. The high sensitivity of CV (1458 µA.mM−1.cm−2) allowed for lower limits of detection (1.34 µM). The fabricated sensor was successfully applied for the determination of D-glucose levels in serum samples, demonstrating its potential for monitoring glucose levels in diabetes patients.",Applied Surface Science
"Novel transition-metal phosphides@N, P-codoped carbon electrocatalysts synthesized via a universal strategy for overall water splitting","© 2022Developing highly efficient and stable bifunctional electrocatalysts plays a crucial role in water splitting reaction. Benefiting from their abundant reserves, superior conductivity and excellent intrinsic catalytic properties, transition metal phosphides (TMPs) draw wide attentions in recent years. However, most of TMPs synthesis processes are still acomplicated and dangerous as the common use of toxic and flammable phosphorus sources. Herein, we propose a universal and scalable synthetic strategy to prepare a series of nanosized transition metal phosphide encapsulated in nitrogen-phosphorus co-doped carbon (TMP@NPC) catalysts by using green and inexpensive adenosine triphosphate (ATP) as a new phosphorus source. Profiting from the in situ and confined synthetic strategy, as-prepared TMP@NPC catalysts not only show nanosized dimension, but also endow extremely intimate interaction with N, P component derived from ATP. All as-prepared TMP@NPC catalysts exhibit excellent hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activities with small overpotentials and robust capabilities. Especially, the CoP@NPC displays the lowest overpotentials of 184.35 mV and 303 mV at 10 mA cm−2 toward HER and OER in alkaline electrolyte, respectively, which also exhibits outstanding stability (over 50 h at 10 mA cm−2) in both reactions. As a proof of further application, as-prepared CoP@NPC acting as both cathode and anode shows excellent performance in overall water splitting. This work not only highlights the green and general synthesis strategy importance in designing and constructing TMPs, but also reinforces the understanding of intimate interaction in coupled hybrid electrocatalysts.",Journal of Alloys and Compounds
A comprehensive review of hydrogen generation by water splitting using 2D nanomaterials: Photo vs electro-catalysis,"© 2022 The Author(s)Transition metal carbides/nitrides (MXenes) with eccentric properties are emerging 2D nanomaterials with intriguing applications in the photo and electro-catalytic water splitting (Wsp). MXenes have a regular planer structure with a large specific surface area (SSA), excellent hydrophilicity, metallic conductivity, and a wide range of functionalities and surface termination groups, making them a promising candidate for long-term hydrogen generation (H2, gen). As a result, their use as electro and photo-catalysts in Wsp to solve energy and environmental challenges has increased. MXenes were proposed to overcome major drawbacks of TiO2, the most commonly used photo-catalyst in solar-driven Wsp, such as high band gap and fast recombination of photo-induced charge carriers. MXene has been rigorously investigated based on TiO2 modification (i.e. in-situ derived MXene-TiO2 and MXene/TiO2 nanocomposite) as well as Metal-MXene co-catalyst that provides simple electron channelization to improve overall electro and photo-catalytic activity (CatA)toward Wsp and increase the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). However, several issues must be resolved before practical applications may be considered, such as weak environmental capabilities and limited intrinsic catalytic activities. Although there have been a few review papers on the synthesis, properties, and applications of Mxenes in various fields, this present work focuses on the most current advances in the synthetic of MXene-derived TiO2 and MXene/TiO2 nanohybrid composites as well as Metals-MXene nanocomposite, clarifying the charge carrier separation mechanism in connection to the formed Schottky junction at MXene- elements interface to attaining high photo-catalytic H2, gen. Furthermore, technical challenges, and enhanced catalytic performance as well as materials design and MXenes derivative with structural features and activity were presented. MXenes' catalytic mechanism is carefully outlined, along with its photocatalytic and electrocatalytic Wsp properties. According to the literature review, Ti3C2 can be combined with a variety of materials to produce electro or photo-catalysis with distinct layered morphology (0D, 1D, 2D, 3D), abundant surface termination groups, and enhanced photo-electrical activities. MXene-derived TiO2 and MXene/TiO2 nanohybrid composites have been proposed as viable electro and photo-catalytic H2, gen alternatives. The photo-catalytic H2, gen rate from Wsp over MXene-derived TiO2 can range from 20 to 50, 000 mol.g-1h−1, with Co-Chl@Ti3C2Tx producing the most.",Fuel
Effects of nitrogen and oxygen on electrochemical reduction of CO2 in nitrogen-doped carbon black,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdUsing carbon black and formamide as raw materials, a N-doped carbon black electrocatalyst (NC) with good performance was prepared by a simple method for the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (ECRR). At −0.86 V vs. RHE, the prepared NC800 catalyst achieves 97.8% of CO selectivity and 9.1 mA cm−2 of CO partial current density, which is higher than most carbon-based electrocatalysts reported so far. In order to better explore the role of nitrogen and oxygen functional groups in carbon-based materials, the nitrogen and oxygen contents in the NC800 catalyst were changed by nitric acid oxidation and thermal desorption. The results show that nitrogen content can effectively improve the CO selectivity of nitrogen-doped carbon materials, but excessive oxygen content inhibits the ECRR activity. It was found for the first time that the ratio of N/(N + O) in carbon catalysts was positively correlated with CO Faraday efficiency and its partial current density, indicating that carbon materials with high nitrogen doping amount and low oxygen content would benefit the ECRR performance, which was also supported by density functional theory calculation. These new understandings provide new insights into the preparation of highly efficient carbon-based catalysts for ECRR.",Carbon
Deep eutectic solvent induced ultrathin Co4N/N-doped carbon nanosheets self-supporting electrode for boosting hydrogen evolution integrated with biomass electrooxidation,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Metal nitrides are considered promising catalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction integrated with electrooxidation reaction of biomass due to their metal-like properties. However, the synthesis of metal nitrides involves multi-step reactions and requires continuous reactions under a large amount of NH3 atmosphere. Herein, we exploit deep eutectic solvent (DES) to induce in-situ synthesize N-doped carbon (NC) composite Co4N ultrathin nanosheets self-supporting electrode on carbon cloth (Co4N/NC@CC) without additional input NH3 atmosphere. XAFS spectra showed that the strong interaction between Co4N and NC accelerated the electron transport at the interface, and the ultrathin nanostructure of Co4N/NC is beneficial to increasing the catalytic active sites, thereby effectively improving the catalytic performance of Co4N/NC@CC. During the HER process, Co4N/NC@CC only needs 62, 98, and 60 mV overpotentials to reach a current density of 10 mA/cm2 in alkaline, neutral, and acidic electrolytes. When Co4N/NC@CC is used to produce 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) and hydrogen fuel synchronously in alkaline electrolytes, only a low voltage of 1.38 V is required at 10 mA/cm2, and the conversion rate of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) is close to 100 % and the selectivity of FDCA is 98.6 %.",Applied Surface Science
Self-supported system of MoO2@Ni2P heterostructures as an efficient electrocatalyst for hydrogen evolution reactions in alkaline media,"© 2022 Elsevier Inc.Efficient, stable and low-cost catalysts are essential for improving the efficiency of hydrogen evolution reactions. Herein, the MoO2@Ni2P heterostructure electrocatalyst was synthesized in a self-supported system on a carbon paper (CP) by two-step deposition and phosphorization at low temperature. The self-supported nanoarray structure makes the catalyst to effectively and efficiently transfer electrons and exposes more of its active sites. Moreover, the strong interaction between Ni2P and MoO2 helps to effectively optimize the electronic structure. The density of states calculations demonstrate that there is an increase in the density of electronic states near the MoO2/Ni2P Fermi level. This shows that MoO2/Ni2P has fast charge transfer kinetics. MoO2 modulates the d-band center of nickel, resulting in moderate adsorption/desorption of hydrogen. The above results show that MoO2@Ni2P has good hydrogen evolution activity. The experimental results show that the overpotential (η10) of MoO2@Ni2P/CP in the alkaline environment is only 57 mV with a Tafel slope of 61 mV dec−1. It is similar to the commercial noble-metal catalysts and outperforms most reported catalysts.",Journal of Colloid and Interface Science
A metal-organic framework derived approach to fabricate in-situ carbon encapsulated Bi/Bi2O3 heterostructures as high-performance anodes for potassium ion batteries,"© 2022 Elsevier Inc.Bismuth-based materials are regarded as promising anode materials for potassium ion batteries (PIBs) due to their high theoretical capacity and low working potential. However, the large volume expansion and sluggish kinetics during cycling are major limitations to their practical application. Herein, a unique Bi/Bi2O3-C heterostructure was designed through a simple Bi-metal–organic framework (MOF) modulation-pyrolysis process. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and X-ray diffraction revealed that the Bi and Bi2O3 can form hetero-particles, which were uniformly embedded in a plate-like carbon skeleton, constructing a Bi/Bi2O3-C heterostructure. The carbon skeleton and the formation of numerous hetero-interfaces between Bi, Bi2O3, and carbon can effectively promote the interfacial charge transfer, shorten the K+ diffusion pathway, and alleviate the volume expansion of Bi/Bi2O3 during potassiation. Consequently, the Bi/Bi2O3-C heterostructure exhibited a high reversible capacity of 426.0 mAh g−1 at 50 mA g−1, excellent cycle performance of 251.8 mAh g−1 after 350 cycles with a capacity retention of 76.6 %, and superior rate capability of 82.7 mAh g−1 at 1 A g−1, demonstrating its promising potential for the application of PIBs anode.",Journal of Colloid and Interface Science
Constructing multilevel structure with microdomains of oxides on Three-Dimensional High-Entropy alloy support toward efficient oxygen evolution,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.High-entropy alloy (HEA) with maximized configurational entropy has shown a great promise for anodic water splitting, but still limited to their unsatisfactory configuration and large-scaled application. In the present study, a series of dual-phase electrodes with spinel MnCr2O4 microdomains pinning on large-scaled and flexible surface oxidized high-entropy alloys (O-HEA) as highly efficient electrocatalysts is prepared by combining modified non-solvent induced phase separation (NIPs) and metallurgy approaches. The precipitation of MnCr2O4 microdomains from HEA support not only result in a shrinking of lattice constant, but also lead to a surface reconstruction. Besides, the MnCr2O4 microdomains can synergy with reconstructed O-HEA support to increase the hydrophilic property and provide high-efficient electron/ion transport, thus promoting the oxygen evolution performance. By virtues of the multilevel structure, the O-HEA2 electrode exhibits impressive OER properties with a low overpotential of 268 mV and Tafel slope of 51.6 mV dec−1 in 1 M KOH at 10 mA cm−2. It also exhibits a long durability exceed 70 h at 25 mA cm−2. This work provides a new prospect for the rational design of large-scaled and self-supported 3D HEA based electrodes for energy conversion applications.",Applied Surface Science
Bimetallic palladium-copper nanoplates with optimized d-band center simultaneously boost oxygen reduction activity and methanol tolerance,"© 2022 Elsevier Inc.The methanol-poisoning of electrocatalysts at the cathodic part of direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs) can severely degrade the overall efficiency. Therefore, engineering cathodic catalysts with outstanding oxygen reduction activity, and simultaneously, superior methanol tolerance is greatly desired. Herein, bimetallic palladium-copper (PdCu) nanoplates with the optimized d-band center are designed as promising cathodic catalysts for DMFCs. It shows outstanding oxygen reduction activity with a mass activity (MA) of 0.522 A mgPd−1 in alkaline electrolyte, overwhelming the benchmarked commercial Pt/C and Pd/C. Meanwhile, it has prominent stability with only 4.0 % loss in MA after continuous 20 K cycles. More importantly, the PdCu nanoplates are almost inert toward methanol oxidation and show excellent anti-methanol capability. The theoretical calculations reveal that the downshift of d-band center in PdCu nanoplates and the electronic interaction between Pd and Cu atoms could effectively lower the methanol adsorption energy, thus leading to enhanced methanol tolerance. This work highlights the important role of tuning the electronic structure and optimized geometry of electrocatalysts to simultaneously boost their oxygen reduction activity, stability, and methanol tolerance for their future application in DMFCs.",Journal of Colloid and Interface Science
A simple room–temperature acid capture strategy to controllably tune oxygen vacancy in Co3O4 for oxygen evolution reaction,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Oxygen vacancy (Vo) engineering is considered as a general but effective way to improve the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance of transition metal oxides (TMOs). However, the deep understanding of Vo is still limited. In this work, a simple room–temperature acid capture strategy is employed to create Vo in TMOs. As discovered in the case of commercial Co3O4 microspheres, the Vo can be tuned by the acid capture time. As the acid capture time is growing, the concentration of Vo increases. Moderate Vo concentration created by controlled acid capture time (less than 32 h) can elevate the electrical conductivity and optimize the electronic structure. With overlong acid capture time (reaching 64 h), excessive Vo will present, leading to enlarged energy band gap, declined electrical conductivity as well as collapsed structure of Co3O4 microspheres, which is detrimental to the exposure of catalytic sites and accessibility of electrolyte. Consequently, the resultant Co3O4 −Vo− 32 (32 represents acid capture time) obtains a balanced Vo concentration while retaining structure integrity, thus displaying a better OER performance than the counterparts.",Journal of Alloys and Compounds
Unveiling selective nitrate reduction to ammonia with Co3O4 nanosheets/TiO2 nanobelt heterostructure catalyst,"© 2022 Elsevier Inc.Electrochemical nitrate (NO3−) reduction reaction (NO3RR) possesses two-pronged properties for sustainable ammonia (NH3) synthesis and mitigating NO3− contamination in water. However, the sluggish kinetics for the direct eight-electron NO3−-to-NH3 conversion makes a formidable challenge to develop efficient electrocatalysts. Herein, we report a heterostructure of Co3O4 nanosheets decorated TiO2 nanobelt array on titanium plate (Co3O4@TiO2/TP) as an efficient NO3RR electrocatalyst. Both experimental and density theory calculations reveal that the heterostructure of Co3O4@TiO2 establishes a built-in electric field which can optimize the electron migration kinetics, as well as facilitate the adsorption and fixation of NO3− on the electrode surface, ensuring the selectivity to NH3. As expected, the designed Co3O4@TiO2/TP exhibits a remarkable Faradaic efficiency of 93.1 % and a remarkable NH3 yield as high as 875 μmol h−1 cm−2, superior to Co3O4/TP and TiO2/TP. Significantly, it also demonstrates strong electrochemical durability.",Journal of Colloid and Interface Science
Enhancing Zn–CO2 battery with a facile Pd doped perovskite cathode for efficient CO2 to CO conversion,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdUsing aqueous Zn–CO2 batteries to store renewable energy and produce valuable chemicals using CO2 as the source is a promising method for CO2 mitigation, that is alternative to traditional energy-costing CO2 capture/storage technologies. However, the lack of efficient CO2-reduction catalysts significantly hinders the efficiency of such batteries. In this study, an efficient perovskite cathode, Pd-doped La2CuO4, was successfully developed for the cathodic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR), and the optimal doping ratio of La2Cu1-xPdxO4 (x = 0.05) was determined. Compared with the pristine La2CuO4 catalyst, the current density for the CO2RR in the H-cell and the Faraday efficiency of CO production are both increased by ∼50% when operated −1.0 V (vs RHE). As a result, the peak power density of a Zn–CO2 battery using the Pd-doped La2CuO4 catalyst reached 0.75 mW cm−2 at 2.23 mA cm−2 by an enhancement ratio of 25%. Density functional theory calculations revealed that the *CO desorption processes on the cathode were enhanced owing to Pd doping, which accounted for the enhanced CO2RR activity and selectivity. The findings of this study show the potential application of perovskite catalysts in the cathode of Zn–CO2 batteries and provide an effective method for battery performance enhancement via the facile Pd doping.",Energy
Multifunctional carbon nanofibers coated Co-Zn alloy nanoparticles composite for efficient energy conversion and microwave absorption,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Considering the energy crisis and environment pollution, it is urgently to develop multifunctional materials to ensure the sustainable development of human society. Core-shell bimetal/carbon composites have attracted great attention in microwave absorption or electrochemical energy conversion devices, and the composite can overcome the deficient performance of pure carbon materials or pure metal materials. In this work, we proposed a simple method to prepare N-doped carbon nanofibers coated CoZn alloy nanoparticle composites (CoZn/N-CNFs) using CoZn(OH)X nanowires and melamine as precursors through pyrolysis process. The prepared CoZn/N-CNFs exhibited outstanding catalytic property for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR, half-wave potential of 0.814 V vs RHE) in alkaline solution. The CoZn/N-CNFs acted as cathode in rechargeable Zn-air batteries (ZABs) exhibited high open circuit voltage (1.33 V), large output power density (223.8 mW cm−2), and robust stability (87 h, 6 cycles), surpassing the commercial Pt/C-based ZABs. In addition, as an excellent performance electromagnetic wave absorber, CoZn/N-CNFs exhibited favorable impedance matching and electromagnetic wave absorption ability, which has the RLmin of − 33.93 dB under a thickness of 2.1 mm, and the effective bandwidth (RL<−10 dB) of 4.56 GHz with the matching thickness of 2.2 mm. This composite is expected to be a desired metal/carbon composite for ZABs and electromagnetic absorption.

"Controlled synthesis of M doped Co3O4 (M = Ce, Ni and Fe) on Ni foam as robust electrocatalyst for oxygen evolution reaction and urea oxidation reaction","© 2022 Elsevier Inc.Electrocatalytic water splitting has become one of the most promising and effective ways to solve energy crises and environmental pollution. In this work, a series of M-doped Co3O4 materials with foreign ions (M = Ce, Ni and Fe) were grown on a Ni foam substrate through classical hydrothermal and calcination methods. It is worth noting that not all doping of foreign ions can promote the electrocatalytic performance of intrinsic materials. The Ce-doped Co3O4 material shows excellent oxidation properties of water (overpotential of 320 mV at 50 mA cm−2) and urea (potential of 1.39 V at 50 mA cm−2). However, the doping of Ni reduces the water oxidation performance of the intrinsic material (overpotential of 410 mV@ 50 mA cm−2), and the doping of Fe reduces the urea oxidation performance of the inherent material (potential of 1.45 V@ 50 mA cm−2). A series of experimental results indicate that the improved activity of the Ce-Co3O4 electrode is attributed to faster electron transport capacity, higher exposure to active sites, and improved conductivity due to doping of Ce. It is noteworthy that the doping of these ions does alter the rate-determination step for the water oxidation reaction. The stability test demonstrated that the current density of water oxidation and urea oxidation of the catalyst had no significant attenuation after a long electrocatalytic activity test. This work provides a new idea for improving the electrocatalytic activity of catalysts by a doping strategy.",Journal of Colloid and Interface Science
A 98.2% energy efficiency Li-O2 battery using a LaNi-0.5Co0.5O3 perovskite cathode with extremely fast oxygen reduction and evolution kinetics,"© 2022 The Author(s)Rechargeable lithium-oxygen (Li-O2) batteries have been regarded as a promising energy storage device, but its practical use is impeded by its low energy efficiency. Herein, a bi-functional catalytic perovskite LaNi0.5Co0.5O3 (LNCO) is employed as the cathode of an efficient Li-O2 battery with a molten nitrate salt electrolyte at 160 °C. It displays a stable low charge–discharge overpotential 50 mV with a high energy efficiency (EE) 98.2 % at 0.1 mA cm−2 for over 100 cycles. The excellent performance is attributed to the extremely fast oxygen reduction and evolution kinetics on the surface of LNCO. The discharge product is Li2O with a porous and fluffy morphology which facilitates the transfer of oxygen and other intermediate species. It is noted that Li2O as a discharge product enables a theoretical specific energy density of 5200 Wh kg−1, which is superior to the Li2O2 as product giving 3500 Wh kg−1 for those ambient temperature Li-O2 batteries.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Unraveling the improved CO2 adsorption and COOH* formation over Cu-decorated ZnO nanosheets for CO2 reduction toward CO,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Electrocatalytic conversion of CO2 to valuable chemicals is a compelling route to develop anthropogenic carbon cycle and achieve carbon neutrality. Controlling interfacial chemistry has been a long-standing challenge. Herein, we report the preparation of Cu-decorated ZnO nanosheets with an impressively catalytic performance for yielding CO in CO2 reduction. In situ infrared spectroscopy, multiple Quasi in situ characterizations, control experiments combined with density functional theory calculations unveil that the cooperation of Cu clusters and ZnO nanosheets at the interface reduces the ∠O*-Zn-O angle on reactive sites and achieves surface modification and electron transfer from ZnO to Cu. More importantly, the Cu decoration alleviates the mass transfer limitation of CO2 by enhancing CO2 physisorption and chemisorption on the catalyst surface, lowers the reaction energy barrier of CO2*→COOH* and facilitates the formation of key COOH* intermediate through a coupling effect, resulting in the selectively electrocatalytic CO2 towards CO.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Reaction pathways for the highly selective and durable electrochemical CO2 to CO conversion on ZnO supported Ag nanoparticles in KCl electrolyte,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Electrochemical CO2 reduction (ECR) is a promising approach for recycling atmospheric CO2 into value-added fuels. However, due to the sluggish ECR, highly effective ctalysts are needed. ZnO supported Ag nanocatalyst (NC) ((ZnO)3@Ag) is developed for CO2 to CO conversion where the faradaic efficiency (FE) was ∼95% in 0.5 M KCl at −1.1 V, and that progressively decreased in 0.1 M KCl (89.7%) and 0.1 M KHCO3 (84.6%). Besides, (ZnO)3@Ag NC exhibited unprecedented stability in 0.5 M KCl with only 6.3% decay after 8 h while 14% and 14.3% decay were observed in 0.1 M KCl and 0.1 M KHCO3, respectively. The cross-referencing results of materials analyses and in-situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy suggest that the high CO selectivity of (ZnO)3@Ag NC in KCl originates from the synergistic collaboration between ZnO and Ag, where, ZnO supplies electrons to Ag for adsorption/structural rearrangement of CO2 molecule and subsequent desorption of CO. On the other hand, the presence of CO32− ions in KHCO3 hinder the mass transportation (i.e. the adsorption) of CO2, resulting in the decrease in selectivity and stability. Hereby, this study will spark motivation for designing the highly selective and stable ECR catalysts and uncover the mechanistic aspects of ECR.",Applied Surface Science
NiMn-based metal-organic framework with optimized eg orbital occupancy as efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst for lithium-oxygen batteries,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Rational design and synthesis of highly efficient bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts is significant for rechargeable lithium-oxygen batteries (LOBs). In this work, a bimetal coupling strategy has been adopted to fabricate Ni/Mn bimetal-organic framework (Ni/Mn-MOF). The LOBs equipped with NiMn0.05-MOF electrocatalyst exhibit excellent performances with large specific capacity of 28,464 mAh/g and extraordinary stability of 524 cycles at 100 mA g−1. Combining with the experimental results and density functional theory (DFT) calculation, it is found that the doped Mn cations enable triggering the redistribution of 3d electron in Ni sites, adjusting eg orbital occupancy of Ni and strengthening the hybridization between Ni −3d and O −2p orbits due to the intense electron coupling between Ni and Mn ions, which greatly optimizes the inherent absorption capability of NiMn0.05-MOF for LiO2 intermediate and thus decreases the energy barriers of oxygen redox reactions.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Realizing the bifunctional electrocatalysis via local charge rearrangement of α-CrOOH-modulated Co@CoMoOx for overall water splitting,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Rational design of highly active, durable and cost-efficient bifunctional catalysts for electrochemical water splitting is critical for aggressive reform of energy technologies. Herein, earth-abundant transition-metal (TM) oxide-(oxy)hydroxide (Co@CoMoOx-α-CrOOH) is synthesized as overall water splitting catalyst via a facile electrodeposition approach. Detailed X-ray absorption spectra (XAS) reveal that incorporation of α-CrOOH can implicitly modulate the local coordination environment and the electronic structure of Co/Mo/Cr cations, as well as their synergistic interaction that contributes to more rapid charge-transfer kinetics and enhanced catalytic activity. The precisely designed Co@CoMoOx-α-CrOOH/NF electrode displays prominent overall water-splitting efficiency that require a cell voltage only 1.57 V to achieve 10 mA cm−2 along with remarkable stability over 24 h in alkaline solution, which is comparable to a Pt/C/ NF || IrO2/NF water-splitting device at the state of the art.

The FeCo-NSCC presents a vigorous bifunctional OER/ORR electrocatalytic activities with the low ΔE(E1/2 - Ej=10) of 0.727 V, superior to most of the reported non-noble metal-based catalysts. Besides, the FeCo-NSCC shows remarkable durability and methanol resistance. The FeCo-NSCC based battery works at an open circuit voltage of 1.52 V and has a maximum power density of 161 mW cm−2 at current density of 246 mA cm−2, better than those of Pt/C-RuO2 based battery (1.47 V; 106 mW cm−2, 145 mA cm−2).

Phase regulation of WO3 for highly selective oxygen reduction to hydrogen peroxide,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), as one of the most important chemicals, is widely applied in many industries. Electrocatalytic oxygen reduction provides a safe and on-site method for H2O2 synthesis. The research of transition metal oxides (TMOs) for H2O2 synthesis is mainly focused on the modification of transition metal elements and graphene. Few studies directly control pure TMOs without changing supporting materials or introducing other elements. Here, we demonstrate for the first time a phase regulation strategy to develop highly selective and stable tungsten trioxide catalysts for H2O2 generation through 2e− oxygen reduction reaction (2e− ORR). DFT calculations show that the kinetic energy barrier (0.08 eV) of the 2e− ORR pathway on the cubic tungsten trioxide (c-WO3) surface is much lower than that of the 4e− ORR pathway (0.76 eV). As a result, a selectivity of 90 % and H2O2 production rate of 179 mmol gcat−1h−1 are achieved at 0.1 V vs RHE under alkaline conditions, outperforming all catalysts previously reported under the same conditions. Moreover, after continuous testing for more than 24 h at a constant potential of 0.1 V vs RHE, the H2O2 generation rate has not been diminished, indicating an excellent stability of c-WO3 in practical applications.",Chemical Engineering Journal

Current and future trends for spinel-type electrocatalysts in electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction,"© 2022Fabricating advanced oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts is of vital significance for the effectiveness of water splitting. Endowed with high catalytic performance toward OER, spinel-type materials are universally agreed to be one of most promising alternatives to the currently used noble metal-based electrocatalysts. Nonetheless, a major issue that limits the practical applications of spinel-type materials as OER catalysts is the high OER overpotential. Aiming to enable spinel-type materials to serve as practical OER electrocatalysts, intensive endeavors have been dedicated to the optimization of electrochemical properties by modifying their structures and compositions. Given that, summarizing the recent progress of spinel electrocatalysts with modified electronic configurations and their applications in OER is highly desirable. This review starts by introducing the OER mechanisms which involves with the conventional adsorbate evolution mechanism (AEM) and lattice oxygen mechanism (LOM). In addition, the OER pathways with spinel electrocatalysts and some important descriptors have also been summarized.

4-Mercaptobenzoic acid-anchored ultrafine Ag nanoparticles for efficient CO2 electrochemical reduction,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.It is very important to design model catalysts to control the site distribution and develop methods to improve their electronic environment and thus promote the catalyst's performance in the electrochemical reduction of CO2 (CO2RR). In this work, a strategy of in-situ synthesis and anchoring of nanoparticles (SSAN) was developed. Using this strategy, a “jujube-cake” type catalyst was designed, referred to as Ag@4-MBA. In this catalyst, Ag nanoparticles (NPs) act as “jujube”, which are embedded in 4-mercaptobenzoic acid (4-MBA) acting as “cake”. A Pointer-shaped Ag@4-MBA material was prepared that achieved high loading of Ag species (∼24.0 wt%), high dispersion (5–10 nm), high CO mass activity (93.7 A gAg−1), high CO faradaic efficiency (94.0%) and high CO production (2.0 mol gAg−1 h−1), showing a superior performance to that of the recently reported Ag-based catalysts.

Metal-organic framework-based catalysts for lithium-sulfur batteries,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Lithium-sulfur batteries (LSBs) have been regarded as one of the most promising successors to lithium-ion batteries owing to their high energy density, low cost and environmental friendliness. However, their practical applications are seriously hindered by the poor overall performance arising from the sluggish sulfur redox kinetics and polysulfide shuttle effect. Over the last few years, introducing catalysts in the cathodic part to accelerate the polysulfide conversion and fundamentally inhibit the shuttle effect has become extensively studied research topics. Various catalytic materials have been employed to boost the whole performance of LSBs. Among them, metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) as a new family of porous coordination polymers have aroused enormous research interest because of their tunable structure, diverse compositions and functional versatility. Herein, recent progress of MOF-based catalysts toward facilitating polysulfide conversion for LSBs is systematically reviewed for the first time.

Enhancing oxygen reduction reaction activity of pyrolyzed Fe–N–C catalyst by the inclusion of BN dopant at the graphitic edges,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.We study the detailed mechanism of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) at the graphitic edges of BN-doped pyrolyzed Fe–N–C catalyst (FeN4-BN-edge) by utilizing the combination of DFT and microkinetic calculations. We find that the ORR mechanism on FeN4-BN-edge active sites is more selective toward the associative reduction pathway for all relevant potential ranges instead of the dissociative reduction pathway. This situation arises because the O2 dissociation energies on the FeN4-BN-edge active sites are too high for the dissociative reduction pathway to take place with sufficient ORR rates. The inclusion of BN-dopant at the graphitic edge of pyrolyzed Fe–N–C is found to improve the ORR activity of the catalyst. One factor contributed to this improvement originates from the easy formation of active site configurations at the graphitic edges, which is induced by the interaction between neighboring FeN4 and BN configurations. Another factor is the formation of the FeN4-BN configuration at the zigzag edge of graphene. These active sites could improve the onset potential for the associative reduction pathway up to 0.12 V larger than that at the standard FeN4 active site in the basal plane of graphene.",Applied Surface Science

The average particle size of the Pd12Ag1 nanoalloy is 4.2 nm, which is uniformly dispersed over the surface of the CNFs. The Pd12Ag1/CNFs catalyst has the best performance for formic acid oxidation (FAO), with catalytic activity (2825.0 mA mgPd−1) and durability after 7200 s (70.6 mA mgPd−1) up to 5.25 and 10.87 times, respectively, compared with commercial Pd/C. The improved electrocatalytic performance of the Pd12Ag1/CNFs catalyst is attributed to the appropriate Ag doping, which changes the electronic state around the Pd atom, forming two new active sites (Pd-Pd and Pd-Ag); on the other hand, the special structure and rough surface of CNFs expose more active sites to enhance the dehydrogenation process of FAO. Furthermore, Pd13, Ag13, and Pd12Ag1 clusters loaded on the surface of defect-free graphene (DG) and single vacancy defective graphene (SVG) were simulated using density functional theory (DFT) to confirm the effect of different carbon materials and doped metals on the overall catalyst at the atomic level.",Applied Surface Science
Construction of novel PG/GeP2 and PG/SiP2 vdW heterostructures for high-efficiency photocatalytic water splitting,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.The development and design of environmentally friendly, low-cost efficient visible-light-driven water splitting photocatalysts is a kind of the most promising methods to solve current energy shortage problems. Herein, the brand new penta-graphene/GeP2 (PG/GeP2) and PG/SiP2 van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures are constructed. Their geometric structures, thermodynamic feasibilities, and optoelectronic properties for water splitting are systematically investigated through DFT calculation. The results show that the band-gap value and band-edge positions prove these heterostructures are promising candidates for water splitting. Meanwhile, The Gibbs free energy change proves that the water-splitting progress is spontaneous. Especially, PG/GeP2 has a type-II band alignment and an indirect bandgap of 2.63 eV, and the electrical properties of PG/GeP2 heterostructure under −2% strain are adjusted to better catalyze the water-splitting reaction, improve the light absorption characteristic and effective mass of carrier. The unique band alignment of these heterostructures photocatalysts leads to high solar-to-hydrogen energy conversion efficiencies up to 10.8%, which has a good commercial application prospect. Therefore, these studies predict that PG/GeP2 vdW heterostructure is important candidates as photocatalysts for overall water splitting.",Applied Surface Science
Using Au NPs anchored on ZrO2/carbon black toward more efficient H2O2 electrogeneration in flow-by reactor for carbaryl removal in real wastewater,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.In the present study, we designed a highly efficient catalyst for H2O2 production using gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) anchored on hybrid substrate composed of ZrO2 and Printex L6 carbon (Au-ZrO2/PL6C). The higher selectivity of Au-ZrO2/PL6C (97%) toward H2O2 electrogeneration and its improved activity in terms of ORR onset potential (140 mV for more positive values) compared to Au/PL6C (80%) were attributed to the synergism between Au NPs anchored on ZrO2/PL6C hybrid support. The results obtained from the application of the catalysts for H2O2 generation on gas diffusion electrode (GDE) after 120 min of electrolysis reflected the following order of efficiency: PL6C (∼140 mg L−1) < ZrO2/PL6C (∼235 mg L−1) < Au/PL6C (∼374 mg L−1) < Au-ZrO2/PL6C (∼600 mg L−1). Given that Au-ZrO2/PL6C exhibited the highest catalytic efficiency, this catalyst was employed for the removal of carbaryl (CBR) using different electrochemical advanced oxidation processes. The CBR degradation tests exhibited pseudo first-order kinetics, with the electro-Fenton (EF) and photoelectro-Fenton (PEF) processes recording the fastest removal kinetics (3.5 × 10−2 s−1 and 4.1 × 10−2 s−1, respectively). The PEF process exhibited the highest efficiency in terms of organic by-products mineralization; this was attributed to the additional photodecarboxylation of the Fe(III)-RCOOH complexes by UVC light. The aromatic by-products, short chain carboxylic acids, and ionic nitrogen species produced during the mineralization process contributed to the successful degradation of CBR. Apart from the analysis with synthetic water, the study also analyzed the treatment of urban wastewater spiked with CBR using a pre-pilot flow plant.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Facile and rapid synthesis of hierarchical LDHs array by universal molten salt with bound water toward efficient oxygen evolution electrocatalysis,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Layered double hydroxide (LDH) is a kind of intensive used and highly efficient electrocatalyst. However, the traditional ways to prepare LDHs are time-consuming and energy cost and the electrochemical properties need to be further improved. Herein, we verified that bound water could exist in the molten salt at a temperature over 190℃. Hence, we developed the molten salt with bound water method (MSBWM), manufacturing hierarchical LDHs one step in molten salt. The as-obtain LDHs exhibit more excellent oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance than corresponding hydrothermal synthesized. Their morphology and electronic structure were analyzed and compared carefully, indicating the unique and excellent characteristics of electrocatalysts made by MSBWM. Especially, FeCoNi LDH only needs 218 mV overpotential to drive 10 mA cm−2 and negligible descent after 24 h stability test. The unique advantages and easy-to-meet preparation conditions promise the MSBWM flexible design and large-scale preparation of hierarchical (oxy)hydroxides as advanced electrocatalysts.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Unveiling the synergistic catalysis essence of trimetallic Fe-Co-Ni phosphides for lithium–sulfur chemistry,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Lithium–sulfur batteries (LSBs) have emerged as prospective candidates for energy storage systems due to their high energy density and low cost of sulfur. However, the fast capacity degradation stemming from the fatal lithium polysulfide (LiPS) shuttle and sluggish redox reaction kinetic acts as the bottleneck for the real implementation of LSBs. Herein, we propose a well-designed nanosphere functionalized with trimetallic Fe-Co-Ni phosphides (FCNP) to host sulfur and promote the sulfur redox reactions. The well-dispersed trimetallic phosphides can not only enhance polarity and electron conductivity but also supply sufficient conversion sites and short sulfur evolution pathway. Therefore, the elaborated trimetallic phosphides on carbon nanosphere effectively inhibits LiPSs escaping from the cathode to anode. Further, the systematic electrochemical measurements and synchrotron X-ray three-dimensional nano-computed tomography (X-ray 3D nano-CT) results provide clear evidence that FCNP as a bidirectional electrocatalyst smoothly accelerates the generation and decomposition of Li2S. Accordingly, the S/FCNP cathode exhibits a remarkable discharge capacity of 1172.3 mA h g−1 at 0.2C in coin cell, 1164.0 mA h g−1 at 0.1C in pouch cell and the favorable cycling performance.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Amorphization-crystallization synergism on MoSx homojunction for boosting photocatalytic H2 production of TiO2 in alkaline medium,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Low-cost molybdenum sulfide (MoS2) has been widely regarded as a potential H2-production cocatalyst for various photocatalysts. However, compared with neutral or acidic medium, MoS2 cocatalyst generally exhibits a very limited H2-production activity in alkaline medium owing to the complex progress, including the H2O adsorption and activation, OH desorption and evolution of hydrogen. In this study, an amorphous-crystalline MoSx homojunction (ac-MoSx) is synthesized and anchored on TiO2 surface to greatly enhance its photocatalytic hydrogen production efficiency in alkaline medium. Herein, the ratio of amorphous to crystalline MoSx phase in the ac-MoSx homojunction can be regulated by controlling the calcination temperature (100–700 °C). Photocatalytic results show that the resultant ac-MoSx/TiO2(300 °C) has the highest hydrogen-production activity (3.43 mmol h−1 g−1, AQE = 16.3 %) in alkaline medium, which is higher compared to that of a-MoSx/TiO2 by 4 times. An amorphization-crystallization synergism of MoSx homojunction was proposed for the improved photocatalytic hydrogen-production activity of TiO2 in alkaline medium, where the Mo atom of crystalline MoS2 can act as the excellent water-activation site, while the unsaturated S atom of amorphous MoSx works as the outstanding H2-evolution active center. This work offers a new and innovative strategy to construct highly-active alkaline H2-production catalysts in photocatalysis and electrochemistry fields.",Applied Surface Science
In-situ topology synthesis of defective MoN nanosheets/g-C3N4 2D/2D heterojunction photocatalyst for efficient H2 production,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Solar-driven water splitting in the powder system is considered as one alternative way to obtain H2 fuel. Recently, graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) has received intensive interest owing to the unique characteristics such as excellent stability, ease of synthesis, and so forth. However, the performance is restricted by the serious recombination of photoinduced electrons and holes and insufficient active sites. In this context, we have developed an in-situ topology strategy to synthesize defective MoN nanosheets with abundant active sites for H2 evolution reaction (HER). Moreover, by virtue of this in-situ topology synthesis strategy, MoN nanosheets/g-C3N4 2D/2D heterojunction was constructed with an intimate interface connected via Mo-C bond, speeding up electrons transfer and inhibiting the recombination of photogenerated carriers. Besides retarding the return of photogenerated electrons, defective MoN nanosheets can also provide considerable active sites, decreasing the active energy of photocatalytic HER. Thus, compared with bare g-C3N4, a 120-times improvement of H2 production rate is achieved. It is expected that this in-situ topology synthesis strategy can be applied to other nitrides and the construction of advanced composite system.",Applied Surface Science
"Tuning the electrocatalytic CO reduction on bilayer C3N via rotation, translation and metal intercalation","© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Owing to the crucial role of the CO reduction in the sustainable development and carbon neutrality, designing tunable electrocatalyst with high efficiency is the top priority for the controllable CO reduction reaction (CORR). Inspired by the interlayer van der Waals coupling modification, we have theoretically explored the tunable catalyst for the CO electrochemical reduction based on the bilayer C3N (b-C3N) via the rotation, translation and transition metal intercalation. Through careful computational screening, we found that rotational and/or translational intermodulation to the transitional metal intercalated b-C3N (TM/b-C3N) can tune its catalytic activity and selectivity efficiently and therefore control the reaction rates and final product distribution. The electronic analysis revealed the half-metallic characteristic of the TM intercalated b-C3N and found that the electrons transferring from the intercalated metal to the adsorbed molecules with the rotated (or translated) b-C3N acting as transferring bridge can further activate the catalyst surface. This study provides a new strategy to design novel CORR catalyst with tunable catalytic activities by mechanical operations, such as rotation, translation and intercalation, and will open a new door for the application of controllable COx reduction.",Applied Surface Science
Multiscale modification of carbon nitride-based homojunction for enhanced photocatalytic atrazine decomposition,"© 2022 Elsevier Inc.Herein, PDI-g-C3N4/g-C3N4 homojunction has been fabricated via the multiscale modification strategy to enhance photocatalytic atrazine degradation. The morphological scale modification was realized by multistep thermal condensation, where the released gas could act as templates to form the porous structure. The molecular scale modification was achieved by the pyromellitic diimide (PDI) decoration, which could distort the planar nanosheet to induce a porous structure and provide more chromophores for better light absorption. The electronic scale modification was realized by the built-in electric field between the PDI-g-C3N4/g-C3N4 homojunction interfaces, which suppressed the recombination of photocarriers. The PDI-g-C3N4/g-C3N4 strengthened photocatalytic atrazine degradation was well-adapted to different environmental influence interference. The optimum atrazine degradation rate within one hour reached 90% in a strong acidic condition (pH = 3.09). It was found that the highly pH-dependent ATZ removal is related to the H2O2 generation during photocatalysis. Within one hour, the PDI-g-C3N4/g-C3N4 could generate 147.38 μM H2O2. In addition, 1O2, Â·O2-, h+, and Â·OH were found to have contributed to the ATZ decomposition. During photocatalysis, 14 intermediates and three pathways for atrazine degradation have been found. Hopefully, this study could pave a way for the development of the multiscale modification for the photocatalyst.",Journal of Colloid and Interface Science
"Theoretical prediction on stability, electronic and activity properties of single-atom catalysts anchored graphene and boron phosphide heterostructures","© 2022 Elsevier LtdIntroduction of graphene-like heterostructures supported single-atom catalysts (SACs) has been considered as a promising strategy for generating sustainable energy sources. By using first-principles calculation, different kinds of single transition metal (TM = Mn, Fe, Co and Ni) atoms anchored boron phosphide (BP-TM) and the effects of added graphene substrate on its electronic property and sensitivity toward the gas reactants are comparably investigated. The graphene support can provide the transferred electron to BP sheet and then regulate the adsorption strength and electronic structure of TM atoms anchored systems (BP-gra-TM). Besides, the adsorption of N2 molecule (parallel and end-on modes) on BP-gra-TM (including pristine and single vacancy (SV) within BP, i.e., BP-gra-SV-TM) are more stable than those on BP-TM and BP-SV-TM sheets, and then induce the change in electronic and magnetic properties of supported systems. Furthermore, the potential catalytic performances of four reactive substrates (BP-TM, BP-gra-TM, BP-SV-TM and BP-gra-SV-TM) are systematically explored for nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR). It is found that the NRR processes on BP-gra-Mn via enzymatic pathways and BP-gra-Fe via distal mechanism have lower limiting potential (0.52 V and 0.63 V) than other ones, indicating that the introduction of graphene can improve the surface activity of BP-TM sheets, which would provide useful guidance to design two-dimensional heterostructure-based SACs with high activity, efficiency and selectivity for the NRR.",Fuel
A highly robust lutecium(III)-organic framework for the high catalytic performance on the chemical fixation CO2,"© 2022Herein, a highly robust dual-channel material of {[(CH3)2NH2]2[Lu3(BDCP)2(NO3)(OH2)3]·4DMF·2H2O}n (OIM-1) built on the combination of wave-like [Lu2(CO2)6(OH2)2]n chains and [Lu(CO2)4(NO3)(OH2)] units was synthesized from the structure-oriented ligand of 2,6-bis(2,4-dicarboxylphenyl)-4-(4-carboxylphenyl)pyridine (H5BDCP) and lutetium oxide under solvothermal condition. Performance characterizations exhibit that OIM-1 has the excellent physicochemical properties of solvent-free dual channels, bigger specific surface area, high porosity and thermal stability. Because of coexisted Lewis acid-base sites including rich hexa/hepta-coordinated Lu3+ ions, N=O and C=O groups from μ1-η1:η1 NO3− and CO2−, and Npyridine atoms, acitivated OIM-1, as a heterogenous catalyst, displays the high catalytic performance on the cycloaddition reaction of CO2 with epoxides into cyclic carbonates under the mild solvent-free reaction conditions of 1 atm and 60 °C within 6 h.",Journal of Molecular Structure
Nickel and oxygen-containing functional groups co-decorated graphene-like shells as catalytic sites with excellent selective hydrogenation activity and robust stability,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Encapsulation of metal nanoparticles is one of the promising strategies to overcome the instability of supported metal catalysts. However, improving the hydrogenation activity of multilayer graphene-like encapsulation remains a critical challenge. To address this issue, multilayer graphene-like shells (MGSs) doped with oxygen-containing functional groups (OFGs) encapsulated Ni nanoparticles catalysts (Ni@OC) were synthesized via calcining the calcination of Ni-based metal-organic framework. The Ni@OC catalysts exhibited 100 % nitroaromatics conversion, excellent product selectivity, and superior stability in harsh conditions. Experimental results indicate that the dissociation of H2 and the activation of nitrobenzene compounds can be achieved with the OFGs doped MGSs as the catalytic site in Ni@OC catalysts. In addition, OFGs promote the electron transfer from Ni core to graphene-like shells and result in structural defects of the MGSs to adsorb hydrogenation substrates. Thus, a reasonable design concept was provided to improve the hydrogenation activity of MGSs encapsulated catalysts with the stable existence of metal.",Chemical Engineering Journal
N-CNT supported Fe/Ce bimetallic catalyst for Al-air aqueous batteries,"© 2022Development and design of low-cost and efficient cathode catalysts for the commercialization application implementation of high electrochemical performance aluminum-air (Al-air) battery will be of significant importance. Herein, we have synthesized nitrogen-doped carbon nanotube (N-CNT) supported Fe/Ce bimetallic catalyst (Fe/Ce-NCNT) by a chemical vapor deposition (CVD) strategy. Ce metal better catalyze the growth of carbon nanotubes, anchoring more iron atoms and increasing the number of Fe-NX active site. The Fe/Ce-NCNT-0.2 catalyst shows an excellent ORR ability (E1/2 = 0.88 V) in alkaline media, attributing to its high conductivity, hierarchical micropores/mesopores structure, abundant active sites. Moreover, the assembled aqueous Al-air battery with Fe/Ce-NCNT-0.2 exhibits a high performance with the power density of 164 mW cm−2 and energy density of 2409 Wh Kg−1 at 100 mA cm−2. The Fe/Ce-NCNT-0.2 possesses high voltage under high current density load, manifesting great commercial potential.",Applied Surface Science
Re nanoflower-decorated carbon cloth for pH-universal hydrogen evolution reaction: Unveiling the intrinsic electrocatalytic activity of metallic Re,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.The hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is one of the primary routes for clean hydrogen energy production to replace fossil fuels. However, the lack of cost-effective electrocatalysts hinders its practical implementation. Re, which is considerably less expensive than Pt, has recently emerged as an electrocatalyst owing to its high HER activity over a wide pH range. However, HER processes of Re have been studied primarily through spectroscopy, with little theoretical interpretation to explain the intrinsic HER activity of Re. Additionally, it is necessary to develop antioxidative Re electrocatalysts to prevent hydrogen intercalation, and to suppress catalyst aggregation to ensure long-term stability. In this work, a theoretical analysis was first conducted to investigate the free energy of each HER intermediate and demonstrate high performance of Re. Then, a novel free-standing electrocatalyst consisting of Re nanoflowers (NFs) grown in-situ on a carbon cloth (CC) was synthesized (ReNF@CC) via a hydrothermal method followed by thermal annealing. The Re NFs homogeneously grown on the CC surface effectively suppressed self-aggregation to preserve abundant active sites, and the direct coupling of Re NFs enhanced the conductivity and physical/electrochemical stability to prevent their detachment from the CC during operation. A high HER performance was obtained with low overpotentials of 103, 115, and 75 mV at 10 mA cm−2 in 0.5 M H2SO4, 1 M PBS, and 1 M KOH, respectively; additionally, a superior durability with respect to commercial Pt/C was achieved. Overall, this study offers a versatile and universal strategy for highly efficient water electrolysis in different media.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Zn single atom on N-doped carbon: Highly active and selective catalyst for electrochemical reduction of nitrate to ammonia,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Electrochemical reduction of nitrate (NO3−) to ammonia (NH3) in aqueous media is a double-advantage process, which can convert the main pollutant in water to the most useful chemical feedstocks. However, the design and development of highly effective and selective catalyst for NO3− reduction reaction (NO3−RR) is still challenging currently, as the NO3−RR contains multiple pathways and suppresses each other. Here, we demonstrate a highly active and selective Zn single atom supported microporous N-doped carbon catalyst, which was characterized by the atomic resolution high-angle annular dark field-scanning transmission electron microscopy, achieving excellent NO3−RR performance (NO3− conversion: 97.2 %; NH3 selectivity: 94.9 %; NH3 yield rate: ∼39,000 μg h−1 mgcat.−1; Faradaic efficiency: 94.8 %). Density functional theory calculations confirm that the atomically dispersed Zn atom coordinated with four N atoms has moderate interaction with NO3− species due to its positive charge. The reaction mechanism and potential determining step for NO3−RR on single Zn atom were further determined. This research provides an exciting new way for the rational design and development of single atom catalyst for advanced electrochemical applications.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Fundamental principles and environmental applications of electrochemical hydrogen peroxide production: A review,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.At present, large-scale hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production is mainly produced via anthraquinone process, which is subject to challenges in transport and storage. Direct electrochemical hydrogen peroxide production (EHPP), a promising alternative to solve the aforementioned issues, has been explored over the past decades, driven by fabricating novel electrode materials with unique catalytic properties, as well as exhibiting outstanding performance in terms of high activity and selectivity toward H2O2 and maintaining long-term stability. Here, we first reviewed the historical development of EHPP, followed by outlining current advances in this promising technology with particular attention given to criteria for rational design (e.g., density functional theory calculation guided by computational simulation), electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction and water oxidation reaction via two-electron pathway. Finally, we conclude this state-of-the-art review by considering reactor configurations from in-situ EHPP to on-site practical environmental applications, as well as discussing the challenges that should be addressed in the future.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Synchronously modulated the morphology and crystal defects of α-MnO2 for high-performance mono-component electromagnetic wave absorber,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Developing mono-component electromagnetic wave (EMW) absorbing materials is desirable owing to their simple preparation methods; thus, it is crucial to investigate EMW absorbing mechanisms. However, owing to the requirements of excellent impedance matching and attenuation capability, EMW material design is considerably challenging. To address these challenges, this study reports an Ag+-doped α-MnO2 with a hierarchical structure for EMW absorption. The microscopic morphology and crystal defects are synchronously modulated, resulting in considerable improvement in EMW absorption performance; an optimal reflection loss of −68.6 dB and an effective absorption bandwidth (EAB) of 4.2 GHz are achieved at a thin thickness of 1.43 mm. Thus, thin thickness, enhanced absorption intensity, and widened absorption bandwidth are simultaneously achieved. The regulating effect of Ag+ doping on the morphology of MnO2 and the corresponding EMW absorption mechanism are also discussed. The findings of this study provide new insights for designing mono-component EMW absorbing materials with higher absorption performance.",Applied Surface Science
Transition metal Dual–Atom Ni2/TiO2 catalysts for photoelectrocatalytic hydrogen Evolution: A density functional theory study,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Dual-atom catalysts (DACs), compared with single-atom catalysts (SACs) that have been widely studied, are now in their infancy, although they are expected to have unique catalytic properties. Here, we propose and investigate the Ni2 dimer on TiO2 system, Ni2/TiO2, that is taken as a representative of metal oxide-supported transition metal DACs, for electrocatalytic and photocatalytic hydrogen evolution using density functional theory calculations. A bottom-up self-assembly approach is developed, which can be generalized to transition metal DACs. The localization and hybridization of electronic states of the Ni2 dimer are illustrated from the coordination environments. As compared with Ni1/TiO2 SACs, the delocalized states of the Ni2 dimer of Ni2/TiO2 not only increase the reaction sites and the reduction capacities, but also positively change the H adsorption kinetics and thermodynamics, facilitating hydrogen production. The band gap of Ni2/TiO2 is narrowed into the visible region, and deep trap levels in the gap are smeared, improving the photoactivity efficiency. Our study presents a facile adsorption-deposition method to design and fabricate oxide-supported transition metal DACs for photo(electro)catalytic H2 production.",Applied Surface Science
Metallic bismuth nanoclusters confined in micropores for efficient electrocatalytic reduction of carbon dioxide with long-term stability,"© 2022 Elsevier Inc.Electrochemical reduction of CO2 to formate via renewable electricity is a cost-effective route. However, the existing bismuth-based electrocatalysts are in oxide form and involve in-situ reduction to metallic bismuth during CO2 reduction. In this work, we demonstrate a nanocomposite electrocatalyst by confining Bi nanoclusters into porous carbons (Bi NCs@PC). In particular, the Bi NCs show excellent stability that can maintain zero valences during long-term electrocatalysis or after months of storage in the air. The as-synthesized Bi NCs@PC catalyst achieves up to 96 % formate Faradaic efficiency (FE) at −1.15 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode. Notably, the FE only attenuates by 7.3 % after 30 days of storage under ambient conditions. In-situ Raman spectrum identify the key intermediates during formate formation. Moreover, Bi NCs encapsulated in carbon micropores could significantly reduce the formation energy of the intermediate *OCHO by density functional theory.",Journal of Colloid and Interface Science
Superwettable Surface-Dependent efficiently electrocatalytic water splitting based on their excellent liquid adsorption and gas desorption,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Superwettable surfaces has been applied for electrocatalytic water splitting, however, in this phase conversion reaction, the relationship between wettability and electrochemical processes is still unclear. Herein, we demonstrate superwettable surface dependent liquid adsorption and gas desorption for promotion of electrocatalytic reactions, where significant change of wetting state leads to an obvious decrease in overpotential of water splitting reactions. Through an amorphous coating strategy, an intrinsically non-superwettable Ni3S2 catalyst can be transitioned into superwettable Ni3S2 catalyst (Ni3S2@Ni(II)-TC), where water contact angle (WCA) is 0°, implying superhydrophilicity, and bubble contact angle is 153°, meaning under-water superaerophobicity. The Ni3S2@Ni(II)-TC electrode reduces the overpotential of OER from 267 mV to 186 mV and HER from 262 mV to 166 mV at 10 mA cm−2 compared with non-superwettable Ni3S2. The two-electrode electrolyzer performs water electrolysis at 10 mA cm−2 with the voltage of 1.53 V for 20 h without obvious decay.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Au/Sn-Beta catalyst with metal-Lewis acid cooperative sites steers aerobic oxidation of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.2,5-Furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) is a potential substitute of petroleum-based terephthalic acid to manufacture polymer. The selective aerobic oxidation of renewable 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) to FDCA is a promising and appealing route for establishing sustainable and environmentally friendly chemical process. Au catalysts have exhibited exceptional catalytic performances for this highly anticipated chemical transformation, where the used support intensively impacts the catalytic productivity from the standpoint of metal-support and guest organic-support interactions. Herein, Sn-Beta zeolite was straightforward and rapidly synthesized via structural reconstruction without the auxiliary of any solvents, which was adopted as support for Au catalyst to construct bifunctional catalysts. As for Au/Sn-Beta sample, Lewis acid sites were related to Sn4+ ions in the zeolite framework, while electronic properties and particle size of Au species were capable of being modulated by Au dosages. In addition, charge transfer from Au species to framework Sn4+ ions resulted in the formation of Auδ+ species. Au/Sn-Beta catalyst with metal-Lewis acid cooperative active sites showed unique catalytic productivity of FDCA product in the aerobic oxidation of HMF to FDCA, whose catalytic performance was correlated with Lewis acid amounts as well as geometric and electronic effect of Au particle. Reaction mechanism analysis revealed the pathway and concrete step that Lewis acid site functioned. The aim is to provide some guidance for constructing a task-specific multifunctional supported catalyst from the view of support-enhanced effect for the catalytic conversion of biomass resource with multi-functional-groups.",Applied Surface Science
Valence engineering at the interface of MoS2/Mo2C heterostructure for bionic nitrogen reduction,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.The natural nitrogenase is still the most efficient catalyst on earth to reduce the ambient N2 into ammonia. The central part of the molecular machine is powered by a metallic core, usually a molybdenum atom, whose coordination valence state remains an enigma for us to unveil and mimic. Unlike the flexible bio-enzyme, inorganic heterogeneous catalysts are usually rigid in the coordination structure, making their valence states invariable, except some localized defects. In this study, we successfully synthesized a two-dimensional MoS2/Mo2C electrocatalyst, which contains a heterostructured interface with efficient charge and magnetism separation, exhibiting a gradual and broad valence state transition from Mo4+ to Mo2+. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that Mo3+ sites at the interface have a strong N2 adsorption energy of − 0.75 eV with the side-on configuration, and an activated hydrogenation of *NH2 species. This bionic electrocatalyst displays a splendid performance in nitrogen reduction reaction with a Faradic efficiency of 42 % at −0.1 V vs RHE.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Efficient transport of active species in triple-phase boundary through “Paddle-Effect” of ionomer for alkaline fuel cells,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.The activity of the catalyst layer is crucial for the performance of alkaline anion exchange membrane fuel cells (AEMFCs). However, the microscopic transport mechanism of active species (gas, H2O, OH–) in the triple-phase boundary (TPB), which is composed of gas, liquid, and solid catalyst particles, has not yet been elucidated so far. Herein, quaternized polyphenylene oxide (PPO) ionomers with different hydratability are synthesized and characterized by the electrochemical performance analysis and molecular dynamics simulations. The results indicate that the mass transport of active species in the TPB depends on the free flow of water and the “locked” water layer hinders the displacement and transport of active species on the catalyst surface. Furthermore, claw-shaped hydrophobic substituents of the ionomers are able to agitate the locked water transport layer on the catalyst surface in a manner that resembled the motion of a “paddle” and thus enhances active species transport in the TPB. The free-water-dominated active species transport mechanism and the “paddle effect” of the claw-shaped ionomer substituent lay the foundation for the construction of highly active catalyst layer.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Electronic changes at the platinum interface induced by bismuth and tellurium adatom adsorption,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Chemical modification of catalytic surfaces by adatoms adsorption is one of the most common methods for designing new (electro)catalytic materials. In this work, the interaction of single bismuth and tellurium adatoms with model platinum basal planes has been investigated using density functional theory to explore changes in the electronic properties of these systems. Calculations indicate that both adatoms are stable, and there is a charge transfer from the adsorbate to the surface in all the systems. As the result, the work function of Pt surfaces lowers and a trend: (100) > (110) > (111) emerges, different from (111) > (100) > (110) seen for the pristine planes. Both Bi and Te cause a noticeable shift in the d-band center of the surfaces, indicating a significant impact of these adatoms on Pt catalytic properties, as experimentally reported. For the Bi/Pt(111), the only system for which similar data has been described, results are in good agreement to previous studies. Results allow to gain insights at atomic-level into adatom-induced changes in electronic properties of Pt, which in turn shed light on key factors that control Pt catalytic activity toward model reactions. In this context, it is found that in contrast to the Bi/Pt(111) system, adatom's electronegativity cannot be considered as an effective descriptor for the enhanced activity of other Bi/Pt, or Te/Pt systems for the oxidation of organic molecules. Contrarily, calculated data offer a reasonable explanation for the reported inhibition of the hydrogen evolution reaction on Bi/Pt and Te/Pt surfaces in light of the substrate's adatom-induced strain.",Applied Surface Science
Ex situ flame vapor-doped oxophilic metals on WP/WOx nanowires for enhanced alkaline hydrogen evolution activity,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Developing effective non-noble hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) electrocatalysts in alkaline electrolyte is desirable for efficient water splitting, but it is challenging. In this work, various oxophilic metals (Co, Cu, Mn, and Cr) were incorporated into WP/WOx films as water dissociation promotors to enhance the HER activity. Flame vapor deposition (FVD) was used for ex situ facile doping of metals on WP/WOx. The prepared metal-doped WP/WOx catalysts exhibited improved HER activities in alkaline solution, resulted from promoted water dissociation step by oxophilic doping metals on WP/WOx. Specifically, Co-doped WP/WOx (Co:WP/WO) film showed the highest intrinsic activity of HER among metal dopants owing to an optimum oxophilicity of Co. Nanostructure engineering was employed to further enhance the HER performance of the Co:WP/WO catalysts. A nanowires (NWs) array of WP/WO was fabricated by thermal evaporation, providing numerous active sites and faster pathways for mass transport and charge transfer. With the synergistic effect of Co dopants and the NWs structure, the Co:WP/WO NWs catalyst exhibited a superior HER performance in alkaline media with an overpotential of 104 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm−2 and stability of over 50 h in 1.0 M KOH solution. Lastly, combining our Co:WP/WO NW – Ir/NF (HER – OER catalysts) with tandem perovskite solar cell demonstrates unassisted solar hydrogen generation by photovoltaic electrochemical (PV-EC) system, generating a solar to hydrogen (STH) efficiency of 10.2 %. Our study provides a rational strategy for developing efficient non-noble HER electrocatalysts that are highly active in alkaline media.",Applied Surface Science
Facile synthesis of a Mo-based TiO2 catalyst via a redox strategy for high value-added conversion of olefin,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdThe activation of C[dbnd]C bond is one of the backbones of the chemical industry, which can be used to produce a variety of value-added products. However, achieving efficient activation of both C[dbnd]C (in olefins) and the O–H (in oxidant) bonds in a reaction system remains a challenge. In this article, a new Mo-based TiO2 catalyst (Mo/Si@TiO2) is successfully prepared by a redox strategy in which a nitrogen-containing coupling agent reacts with an oxygen-rich oxametallacycle precursor. The catalytic behaviors, including solvent types, catalyst dosage, substrate concentration, oxidant/substrate ratio, reaction temperature, reaction time, reusability, and scalability of the catalyst were extensively and systematically investigated. Mo/Si@TiO2 shows excellent cyclooctene epoxidation performance with selectivity to cyclooctene oxide of > 99% and good reusability, along with aqueous TBHP consumption efficiency of 99%. Thermodynamics shows that the cyclooctene epoxidation system over Mo/Si@TiO2 is endothermic and disordered, and the cyclooctene epoxidation rate with Mo/Si@TiO2 obeys the pseudo-first order model with an apparent activation energy of 101.5 kJ/mol. Using some advanced instruments (in-situ FTIR, ESR, ESI-HSMS, etc.) and experimental derivations, the reaction mechanism is revealed to be that TBHP is efficiently activated by the Mo/Si@TiO2 catalyst to generate a peroxide radical intermediate that epoxidizes alkene directly to the corresponding epoxides.",Fuel
Heteroatoms co-doped copper nanocrystals with negatively shifted d-band center for selective nitrate-to-ammonia production,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.To design high-performance electrocatalysts with desired electronic structures is critical to facilitate the conversion of pollutant nitrate (NO3−) to value-added ammonia (NH3) at ambient condition. Nevertheless, the current electrocatalysts for NO3−-to-NH3 still face low Faradaic efficiency and selectivity. We present here a heteroatoms co-doped strategy using phosphorus (P) and oxygen (O) to tune electronic structure of copper (Cu) nanocrystals to form highly active surface for selective NO3−-to-NH3. By combing experimental results and theoretical calculation, it is found that the heteroatom P, O-doping can negatively shift the Cu d-band center, which optimizes adsorption energies of intermediates, especially for *NO3− and *NH3. The P, O-doped Cu nanocrystal exhibits an efficient 8-electron transfer process for NO3−-to-NH3. It achieves both high NO3− conversion rate (91.09 %) and NH3 Faradaic efficiency (91.72 %) in high concentration NO3− electrolyte (1.0 M KOH + 1400 ppm NO3−-N), retaining its potential applications in practical NO3−-to-NH3.",Applied Surface Science
Ambient electrochemical nitrogen fixation with aqueous V2O5 nanodots in a fluidized electrocatalysis system,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.We report a fluidized electrocatalysis system using V2O5 nanodots (V2O5 NDs) electrocatalyst dispersed in aqueous electrolyte for efficiently ambient electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) and nitrogen oxidation reaction (NOR). Compared to the conventional catalyst-immobilized approach, the V2O5 NDs catalyst with such fluidized approach exhibits superior bifunctional activities toward NRR and NOR, affording a high NH3 yield of 575.3 μg h−1 mg−1 and a faradaic efficiency (FE) of 28.7 % for NRR and a high NO3– yield of 1388.0 μg h−1 mg−1 and a FE of 12.6 % for NOR, respectively. The high bifunctional activities of V2O5 NDs are originated from the abundant oxygen vacancies as the active sites for the adsorption and activation of N2, affirmed by the DFT calculations. Furthermore, a theoretical model is built by the Monte Carlo simulation to confirm the important role of nanodots-incorporated fluidized approach in enhancement of mass transport and regeneration of active sites.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Status and prospects of electrocatalysts for lithium-sulfur battery under lean electrolyte and high sulfur loading conditions,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.The high theoretical energy density (2600 Wh kg−1) and high theoretical specific capacity (1675 mAh/g) have led to the emergence of lithium-sulfur battery (LSB), which makes it one of the most potential energy storage systems to achieve commercialization in place of lithium-ion battery. Unfortunately, the slow kinetics and the shuttle effect of polysulfides in LSB severely hamper its rate performances and operating life. The cycling performances and sulfur utilization of LSB have been improved by most sulfur host materials as electrocatalysts under excess electrolyte. However, considering the practical application of LSB, lean electrolyte and high sulfur loading conditions are necessary. In this review, research progress of electrocatalysts in LSB under lean electrolyte and high sulfur loading conditions are introduced. Electrocatalysts are mainly divided into nonmetallic catalysts and metal-based catalysts. Nonmetallic catalysts include nonmetallic compounds, graphene, carbon nanotubes and heteroatom-doped carbon materials. Metal-based catalysts are composed of cobalt-based catalysts, molybdenum-based catalysts, iron-based catalysts and multi-metal-based heterostructures. The improvement battery performances and the related catalytic mechanism of electrocatalysts are comprehensively discussed. Finally, the challenges and prospects on exploring further to achieve commercial applications of LSB are presented.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Reconstructing bridging carbon atoms (from sp3-C to sp2-C) of pyrolytic N-doped carbon to enhance oxygen reduction reaction,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdThe development of new regulation strategy for constructing functional carbon skeletons is a standing challenge for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Herein, the locally ordered graphene microcrystals with suitable N-sites derived from glucose are synthesized under the assistance of low melting point zinc molten salt. Utilizing the structural features of graphene microcrystals (“house of cards” model), the work function of carbon skeleton is reduced after inducing the conversion of bridging sp3-C to bridging sp2-C (ratio of sp2-C to sp3-C increases from 3.75 to 7.41). The lower work function of locally ordered microarchitectures decreases the long-range electron transfer barrier in outer-Helmholtz plane. And the synergy between pyridinic N and graphitic N is beneficial for enhancing short-range electron transfer process in inner-Helmholtz plane. After rearrangement of carbon skeletons, the half-wave potential can increase from 0.846 V to 0.874 V, and the HO2– by-product yield decreases from 31.5 % to 6.9 %. Furthermore, the discharge voltage of locally ordered microarchitecture (1.31 V) at 10 mA cm−2 can surpass the commercial Pt/C (1.25 V) in Zn-air battery devices. In brief, it provides a new direction of structure design for carbonaceous catalysts.",Fuel
MOF-derived single-atom catalysts: The next frontier in advanced oxidation for water treatment,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Over the last decade, single-atom catalysts (SACs) have emerged as a new frontier in the field of advanced oxidation processes (AOPs), since they allow combining the advantages of homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts, eventually maximizing the atomic efficiency. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), periodic porous structures formed through self-assembly of transition metal cations and organic ligands, are regarded as an ideal precursor for the synthesis of SACs. In this review, the synthetic strategies and characterization methods for MOF-derived SACs are described, with special focus on experimental techniques and theoretical simulations employed to verify the existence of single atoms and metal-binding sites. In addition, applications of these catalysts in water treatment by AOPs and electrochemical AOPs based on the activation of persulfate and H2O2 are discussed, paying attention to reaction mechanisms investigated via DFT calculations. Finally, perspectives and research challenges for future development of MOF-derived SACs as catalysts in AOPs are commented.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Electroreduction of nitrate to ammonia on atomically-dispersed Cu-N4 active sites with high efficiency and stability,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdThe electroreduction of nitrate to ammonia under ambient temperature and pressure driven by renewable energy provides an attractive green alternative for ammonia synthesis. However, it is difficult to selectively convert nitrate into ammonia without other side products for long-term stable operation. In this manuscript, atomically-dispersed Cu-N4 active sites anchored on zeolitic imidazolate frameworks with porous N-doped carbon (Cu-NC) were designed to promote Faraday efficiency (FE) and operational stability for the electrocatalytic conversion of nitrate to ammonia. Density functional theory calculations clarify that the adsorption of NO3– at the Cu-N4 site is thermodynamically favorable and the conversion of *NO to *N is the limiting step. Electron microscopy and X-ray absorption spectroscopy results reveal that Cu is uniformly distributed as individual atoms on N-doped carbon surfaces, while the coordination structure of Cu in Cu-NC catalyst is Cu-N4. The Cu-NC catalyst with excellent activity and stability increases the ammonia FE to 82.1 % at −0.89 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) and yield rate to 4731.0 μg h−1 mgcat.-1 at −1.09 V vs RHE, respectively.",Fuel
Challenges and strategies towards copper-based catalysts for enhanced electrochemical CO2 reduction to multi-carbon products,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdElectrochemical CO2 reduction (CO2RR) driven by renewable energy is a promising strategy to close the anthropogenic chemical carbon cycle and simultaneously increase carbon feedstock production. Multi-carbon (C2+) products from CO2RR are very attractive as they are important fuels, chemicals, and industrial raw materials. Copper has received wide attention as an excellent metal catalyst for the formation of C2+ products through CO2RR. Although important advances have been made for Cu-based catalysts to produce C2+ products, there are still challenges such as wide product diversity, poor yield, and high overpotentials. The structure and composition of catalysts affect the binding strength of key intermediates such as *CO and *OCCO during the CO2RR process. Therefore, it is necessary to have in-depth knowledge of the relationship between the structural components and performance to figure out reasonable design strategies. Here, we summarize the favored mechanisms for CO2RR and the possible pathways to produce C2+ products on the surfaces of Cu-based materials. Recent approaches to catalyst design, including structure control, oxide-derived Cu, bimetallic strategy, surface modification, and atomic-level dispersion, are evaluated for their CO2RR performance. Finally, challenges and perspectives in this field are highlighted for further improvement of CO2RR.",Fuel
Iron-induced electron modulation of nickel hydroxide/carbon nanotubes composite to effectively boost the oxygen evolution activity,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.The practical potential of nickel hydroxide for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is hindered by its low electron transport efficiency and weak coupling between hydroxyl groups and active sites. Here, we introduce iron into the nickel hydroxide to effectively adjust the local coordination environment and electron structure. This conception is realized by a facile surface-redox-etching method to grow Fe-decorated nickel hydroxide nanoparticles on the three-dimensional (3D) carbon nanotube networks (Fe-Ni(OH)2/CNT). It is surprising that the Fe-Ni(OH)2/CNT catalyst displays extraordinary OER performance with a low overpotential of 63 mV and 228 mV at 10 mA cm−2 and 100 mA cm−2, respectively, outstripping most OER electrocatalysts. The superior OER performance is ascribed to the 3D CNT networks and synergistic interaction between Ni and Fe in the lattice, which not only accelerate electron transfer but also induce strong electron coupling with OH*, boosting the reaction kinetics of OER.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Dehydrogenation of hydrous hydrazine over carbon nanosphere- supported PtNi nanoparticles for on-demand H2 release,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdIn despite of significant progresses have been accomplished in the programming and development of updated and efficient nana-catalysts for H2 production from a wide variety of chemical hydrogen storage materials. However, it is a practical matter of the utmost importance to develop the “on-off” control for on demand H2 release in the cause of effectively and safely producing, carrying and depositing H2 gas. Herein, we have first designed and synthesized a sequence of carbon nanosphere (CNS)-stabilized bimetallic PtNi nanoparticles (PtNi/CNS), by stabilization of nearly monodispersed PtNi bimetallic nanoparticles onto the surface of carbon nanosphere, for the highly selective and efficient on-demand H2 release upon the dehydrogenation of hydrous hydrazine. Then, the optional nanocatalyst Pt1Ni1/CNS exhibits the highest catalytic performance in hydrogen production from dehydrogenation of hydrous hydrazine, with 100 % H2 selectivity and the turnover frequency (TOF) of 3928 mol (H2)·molcat−1·h−1 at 50 °C. The detailed physical characterizations have confirmed that the superior catalytic performance of Pt1Ni1/CNS in the H2 release upon hydrous hydrazine dehydrogenation is attributed to the electronic interaction and synergistic effect between Ni and Pt. More importantly, the highly selective “on-off” control for demand-based H2 release upon the dehydrogenation of hydrous hydrazine is successfully realized by pH regulation.",Fuel
Computational study on persulfate activation by two-dimensional carbon materials with various nitrogen proportions for carbamazepine oxidation in wastewater: The essential role of graphitic N atoms,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Two-dimensional carbon materials with various N atom proportions (2D-CNMs) are constructed to clarify the optimal catalyst for carbamazepine (CBZ) oxidation and the inner mechanism for persulfate-based advanced oxidation processes (P-AOPs). Results show that peroxydisulfate (PDS) can be activated by all 2D-CNMs with the order of C3N > C71N > graphene > C2N > CN, while C3N is the only catalyst for peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation. The C3N with the maximum graphitic N can activate PDS and PMS in a wide temperature range at any pH, and demonstrates the optimal CBZ oxidation performance. Notably, the graphitic N atoms promote P-AOPs from five aspects: (i) electron structure, (ii) electrical conductivity, (iii) electron transfer from persulfate to catalysts, (iv) electron jump of co-system before and after activation, (v) interaction between catalyst and persulfate. The most vigorous activity of C3N is attributed to the greatest number of graphitic N. This work clarifies the essential role of graphitic N atoms with implications for the catalyst design, and facilitates the environmental applications of P-AOPs for micropollutant abatement.",Journal of Hazardous Materials
Co-Ni-Mo phosphides hierarchical nanoarrays as bifunctional electrocatalysts for excellent overall water splitting,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdAt present, it is still a critical challenge to simultaneously facilitate the overall water splitting reaction by an electrocatalyst with high activity, good durability, and low cost. Herein, ultrathin nanosheets Co-Mo-Ni heterostructured phosphide bifunctional electrocatalysts were constructed on Cu(OH)2 nanorod arrays toward an efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The electrocatalysts are rationally designed to be composed of heterostructure CoMoP, MoNiP, and Cu3P. The formation of M−P bonds can capture intermediates, avoid deactivation, and induce ligand effects to enhance catalytic performance. Therefore, the synergistic effect of heterogeneous structure and phosphorylation is the main contribution to promoting HER and OER. As a result, the bifunctional electrocatalysts exhibit highly efficient with HER overpotentials of 106 mV and 160 mV at current densities of 100 and 200 mA cm−2, and OER overpotentials of 243 mV and 280 mV, respectively. The constructed overall water-splitting cell realized a low potential of 1.65 V with a current density of 100 mA cm−2 and long-term stability, which is comparable to the reported bifunctional catalysts.",Fuel
Rh promotional effects on Pt–Rh alloy catalysts for chemoselective hydrogenation of nitrobenzene to p-aminophenol,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Hydrogenation of nitrobenzene to p-aminophenol over solid metal catalysts in acid medium is a sustainable and efficient protocol. However, it is challenging to fabricate such a catalyst that can achieve both high activity and unparalleled selectivity. Herein, a facile incipient wetness impregnation strategy is proposed and employed to synthesize an activated carbon supported Pt–Rh alloy catalyst. The Pt–Rh/AC catalyst exhibits simultaneously improved activity (TOF value: 10872 h−1) and p-aminophenol selectivity (ca. 95.4 %). The enhanced activity is attributed to the formation of well dispersed Pt–Rh bimetallic nanoparticles caused by the promoting effect of Rh for the reduction of Pt2+. Chemisorption and in situ infrared studies reveal that Pt–Rh bimetallic nanoparticles surfaces were enriched by Pt accompanying with possible electron transfer from Rh to Pt. The density functional theory calculations suggest that the adsorption of generated phenylhydroxylamine intermediate was inhibited over electron-rich Pt to avoid its subsequent hydrogenation to form aniline, resulting in excellent selectivity for p-aminophenol.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Highly efficient and robust nickel-iron bifunctional catalyst coupling selective methanol oxidation and freshwater/seawater hydrogen evolution via CO-free pathway,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.The production of green hydrogen by water electrolysis is often kinetically limited by the sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at the anode. Here, we prepared a bifunctional nickel foam supported NiFe2O4 spinel catalyst (i.e. NiFe2O4/NF) that is capable of facilitating the coupling of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) with selective methanol oxidation reaction (SMOR) in seawater to produce formate via a CO-free pathway. At a cell potential of 2.0 V, the NiFe2O4/NF||NiFe2O4/NF catalyzed HER-SMOR system produces remarkably high current density (>800 mA cm−2) with high Faradaic efficiencies (FE) at both electrodes (>96 % for HER and >95 % for SMOR to formate). The NiFe2O4/NF||NiFe2O4/NF HER-SMOR system also exhibits excellent stability over 48 h of continuous operation. With H2 being the only gaseous product, the HER-SMOR electrolysis system could operate in the absence of a membrane. Furthermore, the NiFe2O4/NF||NiFe2O4/NF electrodes are sufficiently robust for continuously catalyzing HER-SMOR in seawater electrolysis, showing no sign of deactivation or chlorine oxidation reactions over 6 h of continuous operation at a high current density of 700 mA cm−2. Mechanistic investigation and DFT calculations reveal that SMOR proceeds via a CO-free pathway, with Ni and Fe as the active sites for methanol and OH activation, respectively.",Chemical Engineering Journal
‘Green-to-Green’: Iron oxides embedded in lignin-based carbon scaffolds for water remediation via oxidation excluding free-radical pathways,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Advanced oxidation processes (AOP) are a common tool to remove organic compounds from the water cycle. The process is mostly relied on free radicals (i.e., SO4•− and HO•) with high oxidation power in solution. Surface-mediated mechanism could improve this process to prevent undesired quenching of aqueous radicals that widely exists in free radical pathways and alleviate metal leaching through direct electron transfer. In this work, a facile low-temperature pre-treatment combined with pyrolytic strategy was employed to construct a green catalyst with iron oxides embedded in Kraft-lignin derived bio-char (γ-Fe2O3 @KC), upon which radicals stay surface mediated and the activity-stability trade-off is achieved for pollutant degradation. The γ-Fe2O3 @KC is capable of activating PMS to generate non-radical species which are more stable (1O2 and Fe(V)=O) and of enhancing electron transfer efficiency. A surface-bound reactive complex (Catalyst-PMS*) was identified by electrochemical characterization and was discussed with primary surface-bound radical pairs to explain the contradictions between quenching and EPR detection results. We analyzed the γ-Fe2O3 @KC as a PMS-activating catalyst for a wider range of oxidation targets, such as Rhodamine B (∼100%), p-nitrophenol (∼85%), and Ciprofloxacin (∼63%), and found competitive removal efficiencies. The system also shows an encouraging reusability for at least 5 times and high stability at pH 3–9, and the low concentration of iron in γ-Fe2O3 @KC/PMS system implies the carbon scaffold of biochar alleviate the leakage process. The combined findings highlight the applicability in ‘green (source) to green (application)’ processes using cost-effective and bio-friendly iron@carbon catalysts, where alternative oxidation pathways are activated to play a dominant role for water purification.",Journal of Hazardous Materials
Redistributing interfacial charge density of Ni12P5/Ni3P via Fe doping for ultrafast urea oxidation catalysis at large current densities,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Large-scale industrial application of urea electrolysis has prompted one to explore inexpensive and efficient urea oxidation reaction (UOR) catalysts that can achieve large current densities (≥500 mA cm−2) at relatively low potentials. In response, for the first time the robust UOR catalysts are developed via in-situ construction of the Fe-doped Ni12P5/Ni3P heterojunction nanosheets on the macroporous 3D NiFe foam skeleton (denoted as Fe-(Ni12P5/Ni3P)). The introduction of Fe element can not only strengthen the interfacial electric field and induce the spontaneous charge redistribution for heterogeneous Ni12P5/Ni3P, but also effectively lower the reaction energy barrier during stepwise UOR process. Benefiting from the unique ultra-thin nanosheets and the optimized electronic structure, the well-designed Fe-(Ni12P5/Ni3P) possesses more exposed active sites and faster electron and mass transfer, thus exhibiting superior catalytic UOR activity. Encouragingly, the Fe-(Ni12P5/Ni3P) can deliver the industrial-level current density of 800 mA cm−2 just at 1.4 V as well as a splendid Tafel slope of 28.2 mV dec−1. This catalyst also manifests remarkable durability under high current densities. As a consequence, our work opens up a brand-new-path in rational design of excellent UOR catalysts with high activity and stability to enable energy-saving electrolytic hydrogen production on industrial scale.",Chemical Engineering Journal

Developing electrocatalysts with high activity, stability, and low cost to reduce the overpotential and improve electrocatalytic efficiency is a pressing task currently. MOF materials have stood out among various electrocatalysts for their tunable coordination structures and metal atom environments that impose essential influence on the practical catalytic performance. Here, we have concluded and discussed the most pivotal advances in engineering MOF nanoarchitectures for efficient water electrolysis thoroughly. First, we give a comprehensive overview for the modulation of coordination structures and metal atom environments in MOF and MOF-derived catalysts. Subsequently, their applications in water splitting are discussed according to the coordination structure and the local atomic environment. We hope this timely review will provide critical information and insights for the further exploration of MOF-based/-derived electrocatalysts for water electrolysis.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Stabilizing Cu2O for enhancing selectivity of CO2 electroreduction to C2H4 with the modification of Pd nanoparticles,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) to multi-carbon products (such as C2H4) provides an attractive approach to realize the closed-loop carbon economy. Although Cu2O has shown high C2H4 selectivity, it suffered from the low stability due to the easily reduced property of Cu+ during CO2RR. Herein, to stabilize Cu+ in Cu2O, Pd-Cu2O was designed and synthesized in this work. Owing to the high work function of Pd, electrons on Cu2O could be spontaneously transferred from Cu2O to Pd, thereby, stabilizing Cu+ in Cu2O by lowering the localized electron density. Furthermore, the presence of Pd can also enhance the stability of the *CO intermediate, which could subsequently enhance the C[sbnd]C coupling to generate C2H4 during CO2RR. The optimized catalyst exhibits high C2H4 Faradaic efficiency of 63.8% at −1.1 V vs. RHE, which is 1.5 times higher than that of pristine Cu2O. Additionally, the stability of Pd-Cu2O can be greatly improved, both the CO2 to C2H4 activity and selectivity can keep almost unchanged for over 35 h. This work provides an efficient strategy for stabilizing Cu+ and *CO intermediates to enhance C2H4 production efficiency.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Oxygen-vacancy-induced charge localization and atomic site activation in ultrathin Bi4O5Br2 nanotubes for boosted CO2 photoreduction,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Solar CO2 reduction into value-added carbon fuels emerges as a sustainable and significant approach for CO2 conversion. However, poor photoabsorption, sluggish dynamics of multi-electrons transfer and high CO2 activation barrier substantially hamper CO2 photoreduction efficiency. Herein, freestanding ultrathin Bi4O5Br2 nanotubes with abundant oxygen vacancies were initially fabricated for optimizing these crucial processes. The ultrathin-shelled topologies of open tubular scaffolds and abundant surface oxygen vacancies endow the Bi4O5Br2 nanotubes with extended photo-response region and boosted charge separation. Furthermore, the presence of oxygen vacancies alters charge density distribution and affords abundant localized electrons on the catalysts’ surface. These not only reinforce covalent interactions, electron exchange and transfer between CO2 and oxygen vacancies, but also lower the CO2 reaction energy barriers and stabilize the rate-limiting COOH* intermediate. As a result, the OV-rich Bi4O5Br2 ultrathin nanotubes exhibit an outstanding CO production rate of 19.56 µmol g−1h−1 without using any cocatalyst or sacrificial agent, approximately 11.2 times higher than the Bi4O5Br2 nanoplates counterpart. This work provides insights into the future design of ultrathin hollow scaffolds for solar fuel photosynthesis and other applications.",Chemical Engineering Journal

Herein, we demonstrated for the first time that Ca–Co mixed oxide with abundant strongly interacting heterointerfaces for advanced ethylbenzene oxidation performance under solvent-free conditions and using molecular oxygen as the only oxidant. The interface engineering strategy contributes to the formation of weakened Co–O bonds, enhanced oxygen vacancy concentration and boosted reactivity of lattice oxygen, facilitating the generation of superoxide radical anions for driving the ethylbenzene (EB) oxidation catalysis. In addition, the CaxCoyOz catalyst exhibits good recyclability and high stability. This study provides a paradigm for the rational construction of metal oxides with hybrid interfaces towards a lab as well as a large-scale green oxidation of EB and beyond.",Fuel
Selective catalysis of single V atoms and VN1-x nanodots enables fast polysulfides conversion in lithium–sulfur batteries,"© 2022The application of lithium–sulfur (Li–S) batteries are mainly hindered by the shuttle effect of soluble polysulfides and the sluggish kinetics of sulfur redox reaction. Hence, a bidirectional catalyst, in which single vanadium (V) atoms with V-N4 coordination and vanadium nitride nanodots with abundant nitrogen vacancies (VN1-x) are decorated on nitrogen-doped carbon nanosheets (VN1-x@V-NC), was designed to modify the separators for Li–S batteries. Theoretical calculations and experiments show that V-N4 and VN1-x sites display catalytic selectivity for the formation and decomposition of Li2S, respectively. Additionally, nitrogen-deficient VN1-x displays a strong affinity toward soluble polysulfides through V-S and Li-N bonds, and polysulfides are preferentially adsorbed near the nitrogen vacancies. Specially, the strong adsorption ability facilitates the subsequent conversion reaction at the dual-site. Consequently, a Li–S battery with VN1-x@V-NC modified separator based on pure S cathode displays a stable long-term cycling performance over 500 cycles at 2C. Furthermore, the electrochemical performance of pouch cell with 4 mg cm−2 S loading demonstrates the potential of the VN1-x @V-NC modified separator for practical application.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Construction of microchannel charcoal cathodes with spatial-constraint capability for enhancing reduction of NO3− in high-salinity water,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Electrochemistry is a potential technology to remove nitrate from high-salinity water. Due to electrostatic repulsion of cathodes to NO3− anions, the adsorption of NO3− on cathode surface will be interfered, thus limiting the reduction reaction at cathodes. To restrain the electrostatic repulsion, an alkali-etched microchannel charcoal (AEMC) was fabricated as a cathode. Its channel radius was <10 μm but the channel length was more than 4 cm. The function of alkali etching was to create the oxygen-containing groups as active site. During reaction, NO3− anions can flow through cathodic microchannel with high aspect ratio and be reduced by electrons at active sites throughout microchannel surface. For this kind of spatial-constraint cathode, because the diffusion length was constrained in micrometer scale, diffusion driven by concentration gradients will counteracting electrostatic repulsion. Compared to electrodes without spatial constraint, AEMC displayed 1.6 times of nitrate reduction ratio (from 43.9 % to 70.8 %) and 5.2 times of Faraday efficiency (from 11.6 % to 60.4 %). This AEMC cathode also displayed low energy consumption (0.18 kWh/g (NO3−-N)) and a good nitrogen formation rate (100 %) if chloride was abundant. The highest NO3−-N removal capability reached 31.3 mg/(L h cm2), which was higher than those of most reported metal electrodes. These results demonstrated a novel approach to improve nitrate reduction reaction employing a spatial-constraint cathode.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Protonation-induced site and field reconstruction for ultrafast adsorptive desulfurization over Cu[sbnd]N[sbnd]C,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Simultaneously regulating adsorption thermodynamics/kinetics and site density to achieve efficient adsorption capability of single-atom materials is crucial for adsorption-related catalysis, separation, or purification, but remains challenging. Taking adsorptive desulfurization as a model, we report a simple protonation of the uncoordinated pyridinic-N strategy, which significantly enhanced the adsorption capability of Cu[sbnd]N[sbnd]C for dibenzothiophene through the cation–π and Cu–S interaction. The uncoordinated pyridinic-NH+ both acted as an adsorption site and modulated the N-ligand field to lengthen the Cu–N bond to enhance the bonding strength of the single-atom Cu site for organosulfur by upshifting the d-band center, thereby causing a higher desulfurization capacity of Cu[sbnd]N[sbnd]C than its counterparts. Furthermore, the protonation reconstructed the local positive electric field of Cu[sbnd]N[sbnd]C to strongly attract electron-rich dibenzothiophene, which along with abundant porous channels accelerated mass transfer and accumulation of dibenzothiophene near the adsorption sites. This provided Cu[sbnd]N[sbnd]C with 2–261-fold higher adsorption kinetics than most reported adsorbents, leading to an ultrafast decrease in sulfur levels (<10 ppm) within 70 s, considerably outstripping that of Fe[sbnd]N[sbnd]C (∼900 s) and activated carbon (∼1800 s).",Chemical Engineering Journal
Rational construction of FeNi3/N doped carbon nanotubes for high-performance and reversible oxygen catalysis reaction for rechargeable Zn-air battery,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Metal-based alloys encapsulated in nitrogen-doped carbon (alloy@NC) catalysts with high-efficiency and cost-effective are promising to solve the sluggish kinetics of the oxygen reduction/oxygen evolution reaction (ORR/OER) in Zn-air batteries (ZABs). Here, a novel FeNi3 alloy nanoparticles encapsulated by N-doped carbon graphene nanotubes (FeNi3@NC) catalyst with 0D/1D/3D multi-structure is synthesized through combining ligand-assisted and in-situ catalytic assembly strategy. The hybrid catalyst FeNi3@NC exhibited highly efficient ORR catalytic activity and stability. Impressively, the FeNi3@NC only required an overpotential of 291 mV to drive a current density of 10 mA cm−2, successfully demonstrating their excellent bifunctional catalytic activity. Moreover, the assembled rechargeable Zn-air battery based on FeNi3@NC air electrode exhibited high power density of 149.7 mW cm−2 and specific capacity of 658 mAh gZn-1, and long-term stability up to 280 h, outperforming most of the recently reported catalysts. Density functional theory (DFT) reveals that C atom adjacent to the pyridinic-N in FeNi3@NC act as the active sites for ORR/OER, since the alloying FeNi3 combined by pyridinic-N effectively break electroneutrality of the C atom, thereby accelerating the kinetics process of the ORR/OER. This work provides some constructive guidelines for fabricating alloy@NC catalysts with bifunctional catalytic activity and deeply demonstrates the applicability modulate the electronic configuration to construct high-performance rechargeable ZABs.",Chemical Engineering Journal

Herein, a kind of composites of monolayer MBene nanosheets and carbon nanotube (mono-MBene/CNT) is prepared through ice template method for the first time and applicated as a novel cathode host in high-loading lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries. Benefiting from multifunctional advantages of mono-MBene/CNT cathode including anchoring lithium polysulfides (LiPS), multiple functional sites and fast lithium-ion transport, the cells with S@mono-MBene/CNT cathode exhibit superior long-term cycling performance over 1000 cycles. Most notably, even if the sulfur loading is up to 15.28 mg cm−2, the cells with S@mono-MBene/CNT cathode deliver an initial area capacity of 12.73 mAh cm−2 and the capacity can also maintain at 11.07 mAh cm−2 after 120 cycles (86.96 % capacity retention) with current density of 21.80 mA cm−2, which is approximately 3 times higher than the capacity of commercial lithium-ion batteries. This work not only provides a guiding role in preparing monolayer MBene material, but also exhibits the application prospect for MBene material in the fields of energy storage.",Chemical Engineering Journal

Electro-activating of peroxymonosulfate via boron and sulfur co-doped macroporous carbon nanofibers cathode for high-efficient degradation of levofloxacin,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.To address the difficulty of precisely regulating the two-electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e-ORR) and investigate the synergistic effect of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and peroxymonosulfate (PMS), a heterogeneous electro-catalyst was synthesized via carbonation of boron (B) and sulfur (S) co-doping electrospun nanofibers containing iron and cobalt (B, S-Fe/Co@C-NCNFs-900), and used to degrade levofloxacin (Levo) in the electro-activating PMS with self-made cathode material (E-cathode-PMS) system. The morphological, structural, and electrochemical characteristics have been investigated. The results showed that B and S co-doping could remarkably enhance electron transfer and manage two-electron oxygen reduction, which was more favorable for H2O2 generation. Levo degradation efficiency could reach 99.63% with a reaction rate of 0.3056 min−1 in 20 min under the appropriate conditions (pH = 4, current = 20 mA, and [PMS] = 8.0 mM). The steady-state concentration of singlet oxygen (1O2) was calculated to be 669.17 × 10−14 M, which was 15.42, 29.74, and 45.00 times respectively than that of HO2·/O2·- (43.40 × 10−14 M), ·OH (22.25 × 10−14 M) and SO4-·(14.87 × 10−14 M), signifying that 1O2 was the predominant reactive oxygen species (ROS) involved in Levo removal. The high TOC removal (74.19%), low energy consumption (0.14 kWh m−3 order−1), few intermediates toxicity, and excellent Levo degradation efficiency for complex wastewater with various anions and matrixes showed the prospective practical applications of the E-cathode-PMS system. Overall, this study provides a useful strategy to regulate and control the 2e-ORR pathway.",Journal of Hazardous Materials
High-efficient and recoverable Mo72V30@Fe3O4/C catalyst for oxidation of hydroxyfurfural,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdIt is a great challenge to develop recyclable polyoxometalate (POM) based catalysts with high efficiency and selectivity in oxidation of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF). In this paper, MIL-88A(Fe) derived Fe3O4/C is designed as an efficient carrier to entrap Keplerate-type POM and form Mo72V30@Fe3O4/C composite catalyst. Due to the confined and synergistic effect of Fe3O4/C framework, as compared to other reported catalysts, Mo72V30@Fe3O4/C exhibits the highest catalytic activity and selectivity in aerobic oxidation of HMF with a 99.4 % conversion and a 100 % selectivity to 2,5-diformylfuran (DFF). The Mo72V30@Fe3O4/C catalyst still shows a high activity even after ten cycles. A possible synergistic catalytic mechanism is proposed that Mo72V30@Fe3O4/C oxidizes HMF to DFF through a proton coupled electron transfer (PCET) process indicating the polymetallic center in Mo72V30@Fe3O4/C synergistically promotes this reaction. This work not only provides a giant POM based catalyst in biomass conversion, but also highlights a polymetallic active center concept for the design of biomass oxidation catalyst.",Fuel
Co single-atom confined in N-doped hollow carbon sphere with superb stability for rapid degradation of organic pollutants,"© 2022Single-atom catalysts (SACs), which have great potential in the field of water environmental remediation. Development of highly efficient SACs with sufficient stability and excellent catalytic performance was highly desirable, yet remains a huge challenge. Herein, a CoSA/NHCS catalyst was prepared by confining Co single-atom into the N-doped Hollow Carbon Sphere (NHCS) to activate peroxymonosulfate (PMS) for removing bisphenol A (BPA). Experimental and density functional theory (DFT) studies show that the combination of Co-N4 active site and electron transfer mechanism could achieve rapid degradation of BPA (98 % within 1 min). The main active sites of BPA attacked by the electron transfer pathway were predicted by calculating BPA molecular orbitals and Fukui indices. The possible degradation intermediates of BPA were identified by LC-MS and demonstrated to be nontoxic using ecological structure activity relationship modeling (ECOSAR). In a flow-through device for BPA degradation reaction, no deactivation of the catalyst was seen after 60 h and still remained 90 % remove efficiency after 100 h, which further renders it promising for actual water environmental remediation.",Chemical Engineering Journal
High-purity hydrogen production from phenol on Ni-CaO-Ca12Al14O33 multifunctional catalyst derived from recovered layered double hydroxide,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdHydrogen production with in situ CO2 capture by the sorption-enhanced steam reforming (SESR) technology is a promising concept to reduce anthropogenic CO2 emissions. A serious disadvantage of SESR processes is the rapid, sintering-induced decay of its cyclic performance. Here, a recovery approach of Ni-Ca-Al layered double hydroxide (LDH) structure with adsorbed tetracycline to develop a multifunctional catalyst is exploited. The in situ formation of carbon template originating from the adsorbed tetracycline allows for the emergence of favorable structure possessing excess porosity along with deposition of small nanoparticles, thus providing physical isolation to inhibit the sintering of Ca and Ni species. As such, 98.3 vol% H2 was stably produced from phenol in 50 cyclic tests, during which only 33 % decrease of sorption-enhancement effect was observed, ensuring superior SESR of phenol performance. This strategy provides a new paradigm for the rational design of materials derived from LDH for high-temperature reactions.",Fuel
Three-dimensional porous high boron-nitrogen-doped carbon for the ultrasensitive electrochemical detection of trace heavy metals in food samples,"© 2022 The AuthorsExposure to even trace amounts of Cd(II) and Pb(II) in food can have serious effects on the human body. Therefore, the development of novel electrochemical sensors that can accurately detect the different toxicity levels of heavy metal ions in food is of great significance. Based on the principle of green chemistry, we propose a new type of boron and nitrogen co-doped carbon (BCN) material derived from a metal-organic framework material and study its synthesis, characterization, and heavy-metal ion detection ability. Under the optimum conditions, the BCN-modified glassy carbon electrode was studied using square-wave anodic stripping voltammetry, which showed good electrochemical responses to Cd(II) and Pb(II), with sensitivities as low as 0.459 and 0.509 μA/μM cm2, respectively. The sensor was successfully used to detect Cd(II) and Pb(II) in Beta vulgaris var. cicla L samples, which is consistent with the results obtained using inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry. It also has a strong selectivity for complex samples.

Work function mediated interface charge kinetics for boosting photocatalytic water sterilization,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Photocatalytic sterilization is an eco-friendly strategy to utilize solar energy for treating water contaminated with resistant bacteria. Here, we propose interface engineering to induce an internal electric field (IEF) in leaf-like Ti3C2Tx/TiO2 based on the work function (Φ) theory, which enhances photocatalytic sterilization performance by steering interface charge kinetics. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations and in situ irradiation X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (ISI-XPS) results show that photogenerated charge carriers can be directionally separated by the IEF. The efficient charge kinetics benefits the reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and hence a superior broad-spectrum sterilization performance.

Facile construction of magnetic hydrophilic molecularly imprinted polymers with enhanced selectivity based on dynamic non-covalent bonds for detecting tetracycline,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.While a number of methods towards water-compatible molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) have been reported, new strategies affording simple preparation process and enhanced adsorption selectivity towards templates are needed to promote the further development of MIPs. Herein, we propose a novel method for preparing water-compatible MIPs (Cu-CMMIPs) with enhanced selectivity for tetracycline (TC) based on the dynamic physically cross-linking. The as-synthesized styrene-methacrylic acid copolymer was introduced as hydrophilic cross-linking functional monomers instead of conventional functional monomers and cross-linkers, thus eliminating the need of optimizing the cross-linkers/functional monomers ratio. The copper ions served as cross-linker, and in view of increased adsorption capacity and enhanced selectivity of the prepared MIPs, it was hypothesized that the introduction of copper ions would result in the strong interaction between the polymer network and TC. The imprinting process of TC is carried out by direct physical cross-linking of active groups of TC with functional groups of the polymeric network. The resultant Cu-CMMIPs exhibited excellent hydrophilicity, outstanding adsorption capacity and selectivity towards TC in water. Finally, the developed Cu-CMMIPs were applied as magnetic solid phase extraction adsorbents for the specific recognition of TC in environmental water combined with HPLC-DAD detection (LOD is 3.75 μg/L and the recoveries ranging from 91.2 % to 101.3 %). The proposed concept in this work for fabrication of MIPs with facile preparation process, enhanced selectivity and satisfactory hydrophilicity would inspire more ideas to implement in cost-effective adsorbents construction.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Regulating d-orbital electronic character and HER free energy of VN electrocatalyst by anchoring single atom,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Too strong or too weak orbital electron-coupling with active adsorbents basically results in unsatisfied free energies, and consequently limiting the HER kinetics and activity. Herein, Co-VN catalyst is fabricated to highlight that atomically implanted Co into VN can regulate its d orbital electronic character and corresponding free energy for further improving its alkaline HER performances. Experimental results and density functional theory calculations reveal that atomically implanted Co into VN could induce local charge redispersion to further downshift the d band center position of V-3d in Co-VN. The lowered d band center of the V-3d could not only decrease the d orbital electron-coupling between V site and O atom of OH intermediate to boost desorption of OH species and H2O dissociation kinetics, but also simultaneously balance the hydrogen adsorption free energy to facilitate the desorption of as-formed H2, both of which synergistically increase the Volmer and Heyrovsky kinetics and overall HER activity of Co-VN. Moreover, the structural stability of Co-VN after long-term HER is also investigated by transmission electron microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy to uncover its activity-stability trade-off riddle. As a result, Co-VN catalyst expectantly displays a low overpotential of 59 mV at −10 mA cm−2, a small Tafel slope of 46.3 mV dec−1, and a favorable long-term stability. The proposed regulation strategy of orbital electronic structure and free energy could be extended to design other high-performance catalysts.",Chemical Engineering Journal

The modified bimetallic core–shell catalyst was used in the hydrogenation of phenol, and the catalytic results showed that the Co modification effectively improved the catalytic performance of the Pd-based catalyst, especially, it reduced the activation energy of the reaction and greatly improve the conversion of phenol. Combined with characterization, it was found that Co doping reduced the particle size of Pd metal particles and affected the adsorption capacity of substrate phenol on the surface of Pd metal. The conversion of phenol was close to 99.9 % within 1 h at 80 °C, while the selectivity of cyclohexanone reached 95.4 %. In addition, the core–shell structure provided a stable environment for the catalyst, which still maintained high activity after being recycled for 5 times.",Fuel

A promising nanoporous W-doped oxygen vacancy-containing NiFe layered double hydroxides (NiFeW-LDHs) electrocatalyst is directly grown on nickel foam via electrodeposition combined with chemical corrosion. With an appropriate amount of W dopant in NiFe-LDHs, the electronic structures of Ni and Fe are modulated by the changes in local environment, and the oxygen vacancy concentration is further optimized, resulting in abundant OER electrocatalytic active centers on the electrocatalyst surface. Due to the excellent electronic conductivity and three-dimensional nanoporous configuration, the representative NiFeW3-LDHs exhibit remarkable OER electrocatalytic activity with a low overpotential (211 mV at 10 mA cm−2), a small Tafel slope (36.44 mV dec–1), and fine stability (more than 120 h at 10 mA cm−2).

Recent progress of hollow structure platform in assisting oxygen evolution reaction,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Hydrogen production by water electrolysis has received extensive attention, mainly due to the fact that the process does not emit carbon dioxide and other pollutants. Whereas, the kinetic process of the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is very sluggish due to the four-electron proton coupling mechanism, which seriously affects the hydrogen production efficiency.

An Agar gel modulation with melamine foam skeleton for flexible Zn-air batteries,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Flexible zinc-air batteries (FZABs) have excellent application prospects in flexible wearable electronic devices due to their high safety and low cost. However, zinc electrode passivation, low conductivity of the solid-state electrolyte (SSE), and poor mechanical properties severely limit the areal capacity of the FZABs, which is challenging to meet the requirements of flexible electronic equipment for flexible power supply devices. Herein, an environment-friendly Agar gel SSE is prepared for FZABs. To further improve the mechanical strength and electrochemical performance of the Agar-based zinc-air battery, melamine-Agar SSE (M-Agar SSE) is fabricated by introducing melamine foam (M foam) skeleton into Agar gel. Compared with Agar gel electrolyte, the prepared M-Agar SSE delivers essentially improved properties in terms of mechanical strength, water retention capability, and ionic conductivity.

Strong electronic coupling between single Ru atoms and cobalt-vanadium layered double hydroxide harness efficient water splitting,"© 2022Atomic coordination modulation and electronic structure engineering are appealing routes to develop versatile electrocatalysts targeting high-performance water electrolysis. Herein, atomically dispersed Ru sites are successfully anchored on the surface of CoV layered double hydroxide (LDH), affording a vertically aligned and interconnected nanosheet array architecture. Benefitting from the strong electronic coupling, fast charge transfer capability and well-defined morphology of as-prepared catalyst, ultralow overpotentials for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER, η10 = 28 mV) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER, η25 = 263 mV) are required. The two-electrode configuration cell only requires a cell voltage of 1.52 V to reach 10 mA cm−2, which is lower than that of commercialized Pt/C||RuO2 couple. Synchrotron X-ray absorption spectroscopy studies in combination with density functional theory calculations reveal that the strong electronic coupling between monatomic Ru with CoV LDH induces spatial charge redistribution and a distorted coordination environment around V atoms, thereby accelerating the hydrogen release for HER and reducing the rate-determining step (O* → OOH*) free energy for OER.",Chemical Engineering Journal

Directed self-assembled pathways of 3D rose-shaped PtNi@CeO2 electrocatalyst for enhanced hydrogen evolution reaction,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.The development of high electrocatalytic activity and low-cost Pt-containing catalyst is highly feasible for hydrogen evolution reactions under alkaline conditions. In this study, a series of three-dimensional (3D) rose-shaped cerium (IV) oxide (CeO2)-supported Pt and Ni alloy nanocomposite catalysts were prepared by a direct solvothermal method (PtxNiy @CeO2), and the catalytic activity of the prepared catalysts in hydrogen evolution reactions was studied.

Markedly boosted peroxymonosulfate- and periodate-based Fenton-like activities of iron clusters on sulfur/nitrogen codoped carbon: Key roles of a sulfur dopant and compared activation mechanisms,"© 2022Highly dispersed iron nanoclusters on carbon (FeNC@C) hold great promise for wastewater purification in Fenton-like reactions. The microenvironment engineering of central Fe atom is promising to boost the activation capacity of FeNC@C, which is however remains a challenge. This study developed a self-sacrificed templating strategy to S, N-codoped carbon supported Fe nanoclusters (FeNC@SNC) activator and find the key role of sulfur heteroatoms in regulating the electron structure of Fe sites and final activation property. Investigations revealed that the FeNC@SNC composite exhibited unusual bifunctional activity in both peroxymonosulfate (PMS)- and periodate (PI)-based Fenton-like reactions. We also offered insights into the differences between the degradation of organics by the FeNC@SNC/PMS and FeNC@SNC/PI systems. Specifically, under identical conditions, the FeNC@SNC/PMS system delivered a higher oxidation capability and stronger resistance to nontarget matrix constituents, but showed more severe Fe leaching than the FeNC@SNC/PI system. Furthermore, while mediated electron-transfer process was identified as the major route for pollutant decomposition in both systems, the high-valent Fe-oxo species [Fe (IV)] was the auxiliary reactive species found only in the FeNC@SNC/PMS system. Based on these findings, our results provide profound insights into the design of active and durable Fe-based activators toward highly efficient Fenton-like reactions.",Science of the Total Environment
Fe-g-C3N4/reduced graphene oxide lightless application for efficient peroxymonosulfate activation and pollutant mineralization: Comprehensive exploration of reactive sites,"© 2022To overcome the shortcomings of homogeneous Fe ion activating peroxymonosulfate (PMS), such as high pH-dependence, limited cycling of Fe(III)/Fe(II) and sludge production, graphite carbon nitride (g-C3N4) is chosen as a support for Fe ions, and reduced graphene oxide (rGO) is employed to facilitate the electron transfer process, thereby enhancing catalysis. Herein, a ternary catalyst, Fe-g-C3N4/rGO, is first applied under lightless condition for PMS activation, which exhibits ideal performance for contaminant mineralization. 82.5 % of the total organic carbon (TOC) in 100 mL of 5 mg/L bis-phenol A (BPA) was removed within 20 min by the optimal catalyst named 30%rFe0.2CN, which shows a strong pH adaptability over the range of 3–11 compared with a common Fenton-like system. Moreover, the highly stable Fe-g-C3N4/rGO/PMS catalytic system resists complex water matrices, especially those with high turbidity. To unveil the mechanism of PMS activation and pollutant degradation, the physicochemical properties of the as-prepared catalysts are comprehensively characterized by multiple techniques. The Fe(III) contained in both the Fe-N group and α-Fe2O3 component of 30%rFe0.2CN not only directly reacts with PMS to produce sulfate radicals ([rad]SO4−) and hydroxyl radicals ([rad]OH), but also combines with PMS to form the essential [Fe(III)OOSO3]+ active complex, thereby generating superoxide radicals ([rad]O2−) and singlet oxygen (1O2). Among the various reactive oxidizing species, 1O2 plays an important role in pollutant removal, which is additionally generated by the C[dbnd]O moiety of the catalyst activating PMS as well as PMS self-oxidation, indicating the dominance of the non-radical pathway in the pollutant degradation process. Due to the advantages of high efficiency, wide pH adaptability and stability, the proposed lightless Fe-g-C3N4/rGO/PMS catalytic system represents a promising avenue for practical wastewater purification.",Science of the Total Environment

Control on Pt-containing ordered honeycomb mesoporous nanostructures via self-assembly of block copolymer,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Control on the mesoporous nanostructures with uniform-sized and well-arranged mesopores can provide enhanced surface areas and mechanical properties, which are preferred for the development of energies, sensors, and electro-optical devices. Herein, Pt-containing ordered honeycomb (Pt/OHC) nanocomposites with regularly arranged mesopores were synthesized via self-assembly of polystyrene-block-poly(4-vinylpyridine) (PS-b-P4VP) block copolymers (BCPs), following mechanism study of morphological evolution, concept of structural control, potential in catalyst application, and exploration of various metals. Particularly, it was found that the self-assembly of BCP directed the ordered arrangement of the mesopores, whereas the P4VP blocks incorporated Pt and precisely positioned it on the pore walls and on the outer surface of the honeycomb matrix. Mono- to multi-layered Pt/OHCs could be generated by controlling the thicknesses of the self-assembled pristine templates, and the average diameters of the mesopores could be varied from 12 nm to 40 nm by tuning the PS:P4VP block mass ratios. The obtained Pt/OHC demonstrated promising application as electrocatalysts in hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), for which an overpotential of 39 mV at current density of 10 mA/cm2 (η10) and a high half wave potential (E1/2) of 0.87 V (vs. RHE), respectively, were observed in acidic media. In addition, the strategy developed here could be expanded for other metals, such as Au and Ir, to be incorporated into the ordered honeycomb matrix, providing a robust method to synthesize metal-containing mesoporous nanomaterials. With this work, we aim to offer an insight of designing ordered mesoporous nanocomposites, a concept of control over the mesoporous nanostructures, and a potential for their application in electrocatalysts.",Colloids and Surfaces A: Physicochemical and Engineering Aspects
One-pot controllable epitaxial growth of Pd-based heterostructures for enhanced formic acid oxidation,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Epitaxial heterostructures with controlled composition and morphology are of particular interest thanks to their fantastic physicochemical properties for energy, electronic devices, and catalysis. Nonetheless, big challenges remain in the facile and controllable preparation of noble-metal-based heterostructures. Herein, we report one-pot controllable epitaxial growth of Pd-based heterostructures composed of W doped Pd nanosheets growing along the edges of small-nanosheet-assembled Pd nanocrystals by adjusting the decomposition temperature of W(CO)6, which shows greatly enhanced catalytic activity, stability, and selectivity for formic acid oxidation compared to the control samples including small-nanosheet-assembled Pd nanocrystals, Pd nanosheets, and Commercial Pd/C catalysts. Our study demonstrates a convenient method to controllably prepare Pd-based heterostructures, and offers new opportunities to create various epitaxial heterostructures with unique properties and promising applications.",Colloids and Surfaces A: Physicochemical and Engineering Aspects
Self-standing CoFe embedded nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes with Pt deposition through direct current plasma magnetron sputtering for direct methanol fuel cells applications,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdHerein, ultra-low amount Pt is uniformly deposited on the surface of CoFe nanoparticles (NPs) embedded nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes which are grown directionally on the surface of carbon fiber cloth (Pt–CoFe@NCNT/CFC) using the direct current plasma magnetron sputtering (DC-PMS) technique. The designed electrode exhibits excellent trifunctional catalytic activities towards oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) (in 0.1 M KOH, E1/2 = 0.807 V; in 0.5 M H2SO4, E1/2 = 0.723 V), hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) (in 1 M KOH, η10 = 17 mV and η100 = 93 mV; in 0.5 M H2SO4, η10 = 42 mV and η100 = 100.5 mV) and methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) (in 0.5 M H2SO4 + 0.5 M CH3OH, peak current density reaches 115 mA mg−1Pt@1.116 V). It is verified that the DC-PMS technique can greatly improve the utilization efficiency of Pt, so as to reduce the dosage of Pt, and shows better catalytic performance and excellent stability than the commercial Pt/C catalysts. The rich hierarchical heterostructures of the designed electrode can provide more non-noble metal active sites, so as to enhance the catalytic activity and further cut down the consumption of noble metals. Impressively, Pt–CoFe@NCNT/CFC electrode assembled direct methanol fuel cell achieved a remarkable maximum power density of 73.41 mW cm−2 and shows excellent stability.",Carbon
Designing catalysts via evolutionary-based optimization techniques,"© 2022Methodologies to design efficient, affordable, and sustainable catalysts have advanced rapidly in recent years. With advances in computational power and the rapid development of computational methods, the scientific community is turning to material simulations to investigate the hidden potential of a plethora of possibly undiscovered materials in incredibly short timeframes, usually impossible via trial-and-error experimental approaches. This review article provides an overview of evolutionary-based optimization techniques with a special focus on Genetic Algorithms (GA's) and their potential use in the catalyst design process. The ‘descriptors’ required to design catalysts via evolutionary-based optimization techniques are discussed explicitly for five key chemical reactions, namely, the Oxygen Evolution Reaction (OER), the Oxygen Reduction Reaction (ORR), the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction (HER), the Nitrogen Reduction Reaction (NRR), and the CO2 Reduction Reaction (CO2RR). The descriptors and their appraisal discussed in this review will facilitate researchers using evolutionary-based optimization techniques for catalyst design and discovery.",Computational Materials Science
In situ decoration of Co3O4 on N-doped hollow carbon sphere as an effective bifunctional oxygen electrocatalyst for oxygen evolution and oxygen reduction reactions,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Transition metal oxide based materials are believed as a sustainable and effective electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution and oxygen reduction reactions (OER/ORR). However, poor conductivity, specific surface area, and tunable crystallography are major bottlenecks. To alleviate such issues, we developed a highly active spinel Co3O4 decorated N-doped hollow carbon sphere (Co3O4/NHCS) by single step decoration using cobalt phthalocyanine (CoPc) precursor for the first time. The introduction of various extents of CoPc significantly affects the sphere wall thickness, defect sites, doping amount of cobalt content, and the concentration of Co3+ and Co2+ sites. The resulting optimum loading of 0.2 g of Co3O4/NHCS-0.2, exhibits a highly uniform hollow carbon sphere with a high wall thickness (61 nm), better surface area (445 m2 g−1), and moderate defect sites. Notably, an exterior concentration of octahedral Co3+ (35.50%) and tetrahedral Co2+ (26.54%) sites serve as the active centres for OER and ORR, respectively. Remarkably, the obtained material exhibits exceptional OER performance with a potential of 1.80 V vs. RHE in 0.1 M KOH medium for achieving a current density of 10 mA cm−2, outperforming the benchmark RuO2 material. In addition, Co3O4/NHCS-0.2 demonstrates an impressive ORR electrocatalytic activity with onset potential of 0.89 V vs. RHE, excellent current density of 5.0 mA cm−2, lower Tafel slope of 60 mV dec−1 and close to four electron transfer. Moreover, the moderate carrier concentration, flat band potential, higher tetrahedral Co2+ and pyridinic N sites significantly improved the ORR activity and methanol oxidation tolerance ability.",Colloids and Surfaces A: Physicochemical and Engineering Aspects
Cobalt-based N-doped bamboo-like graphene tubes with enhanced durability for efficient oxygen reduction reaction in direct borohydride fuel cell,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdExploring efficient non-precious metal cathode catalysts is attracting ever-increasing interest in the development of direct borohydride fuel cell (DBFC). Herein, a cobalt-based nitrogen-doped bamboo-like graphene tube (Co-NGT) is prepared as an efficient cathode catalyst. The Co-NGT consists of bamboo-like graphene tubes (40–130 nm in diameter and ∼10 μm in length), as well as cobalt nanoparticles (50–100 nm in diameter) confined in the graphene tubes. The Co-NGT shows an onset reduction potential of 0.964 V and an almost four-electron pathway towards oxygen reduction reaction, as well as a negative shift of 8 mV in half-wave potential after 10,000 CV cycles. The Tafel slope of the Co-NGT catalyst is 47 mV decade−1, which is by ca. 37.8 mV decade−1 smaller than for Pt/C. A DBFC using the Co-NGT cathode yields the biggest power density of 453 mW cm−2 at 60 °C and a life span of over 120 h. The excellent electrocatalytic properties and superior durability of Co-NGT catalyst arise from the highly graphitized NGT, providing strong interaction with Co nanoparticles and mitigating the agglomeration of Co nanoparticles. Our study guides for composition and structural design of high-efficient cathode catalysts of DBFC.",Carbon
Electrochemically embedded nickel oxide in a highly porous manganese oxide film with enhanced catalytic kinetics of the urea oxidation reaction,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.The use of well-dispersed nickel catalysts with atomic-scale sizes is an effective approach for maximizing catalytic activity and selectivity for the urea oxidation reaction (UOR). Herein, a porous ultrathin film of Birnessite-type manganese oxide is anodically deposited on a nickel substrate as a catalyst support. Some of the intercalated sodium ions are replaced by the dissolved nickel ions from the nickel substrate in the anodic process, forming manganese oxide with partially intercalated nickel ions (denoted MnO2). The amount of nickel species can be easily increased by cyclic voltammetry in the nickel sulfate electrolyte (denoted MnO2-Ni), without the relatively time-consuming process of conventional ion exchange. Most of the embedded nickel species are catalytic Ni3+ ions, rendering MnO2-Ni a favorable catalyst to boost the UOR. The cyclic voltammetry results reveal that Ni3+ catalysts, when inserted into the layer-structured manganese oxide, can increase the electroactive surface area for the adsorption of urea and increase the charge-transfer rate constant for the Ni3+/Ni2+ redox couple, leading to an improved catalytic rate constant of the UOR. A highly porous manganese oxide matrix provides many transport pathways for facilitating UOR kinetics. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy shows that MnO2-Ni has lower direct and indirect UOR impedances than MnO2 and bare Ni electrodes, leading to a greater oxidation current and lower onset potential.",Journal of Alloys and Compounds
Revealing the activity origin of oxygen-doped amorphous carbon material for SO2 catalytic oxidation: A descriptor considering dynamic electron transfer during O2 activation,"© 2022Carbon-based catalytic oxidation widely exists in contamination control, energy conversion and chemical production, in which amorphous carbon containing heteroatom is commonly used carbocatalyst. Compared with crystalline carbon, small-sized aromatic carbon clusters in amorphous carbon exhibit edge and size effect for catalytic oxidation; however, the activity origin, especially accurate activity descriptor remains to be explored. Herein, using SO2 catalytic oxidation as the probe reaction, a combined computational and experimental investigation was conducted to reveal the activity origin of oxygen-doped amorphous carbon. By density functional theory calculations on various oxygen-doped carbon clusters, a site-specific descriptor considering dynamic electron transfer effect was proposed via combining Fukui function and Mulliken electronegativity, based on which the catalytic activity is found to be determined by both oxygen groups and edges. The configuration with cyclic ether embedded into K-region edge is predicted to own the highest activity with O2 activation and SO2 oxidation barrier as low as 35.4 and 89.3 kJ mol−1. SO2 catalytic oxidation dynamic experiments using model amorphous carbocatalysts further validate the favorable role of ether group and edges. This work demonstrates quantitative descriptor for O2 activation and catalytic oxidation on amorphous carbocatalyst, providing guidance for designing high-performance carbocatalyst considering size and edge effect.",Carbon
Unraveling the effects of P and S doping over g-C3N4 in strengthening Lewis basicity for CO2/glycerol conversion: A theoretical and experimental study,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdConversion of CO2 to chemicals and fuels has attracted considerable attention as CO2 is a nontoxic, non-flammable, and cheap carbon-oxygen source. However, the kinetics of CO2 conversion into other chemicals remains a challenge due to its thermodynamic stability. Herein, P and S co-doped graphitic-carbon nitride (PSCN) catalyst was synthesized through one-step thermal condensation to improve its Lewis acidity and basicity and investigate carbon dioxide/glycerol (CO2/GLY) conversion. The catalytic GLY conversion at 210 °C reached 60% and 85% using pristine g-C3N4 (CN) and PSCN, respectively, with CO2 as a carbon feedstock and CH3CN as a dehydrating agent. Density-functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that the efficient charge transfer resulting from P and S doping could increase the catalytic activity for CO2/GLY conversion by lowering the activation barrier. This is the first study to demonstrate the catalytic activity of the PSCN catalyst for the CO2/GLY conversion and the computational work for the GLY carboxylation reaction. Moreover, the interaction site and adsorption energy were investigated for the adsorption of CO2 and GLY on PSCN and CN to elucidate the reaction mechanism. Our results demonstrated that PSCN could serve as a superior catalyst and pave new light for CO2/GLY conversion.",Carbon
Fabrication of N−doped carbon nanotube/carbon fiber dendritic composites with abundant interfaces for electromagnetic wave absorption,"© 2022Three−dimensional (3D) hierarchical nano−microstructures have shown unprecedented physicochemical properties. However, it still remains great challenge to construct well−defined architectures with 3D hierarchical feature. Herein, we develop an electrospinning technique followed by a high−temperature carbonization process to fabricate N−doped carbon fibers (NCF) with N−doped carbon nanotubes (NCNTs) vertically grown on the surface of NCF using the Fe species as catalysts. In the 3D hierarchical structures, the Fe3C nanoparticles (NPs) are embedded within NCF matrix, while the Fe NPs are encapsulated within NCNT. Due to the unique structural feature, the as−prepared hierarchical structure exhibits excellent electromagnetic wave absorption performance with an absorption bandwidth of 4.0 GHz and a minimum reflection loss of −49.56 dB with a thickness as low as 1.50 mm. Experimental and theoretical studies indicate that the enhanced electromagnetic wave absorption performance of the hierarchical structure can be explained by the increased conduction loss induced by the introduction of metallic NPs and formation of 3D conductive networks, and the enhanced polarization loss caused by the additional interfaces and defects in the hierarchical structure. This work provides an efficient way to fabricate 3D architecture for high−efficiency electromagnetic wave absorption.",Carbon
Identification of ORR activity of random graphene-based systems using the general descriptor and predictive model equation,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdCarbon based electrocatalysts are well known promising candidates for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), but the random approach to find the best catalyst using experimental method delayed the screening process and it leads to a huge cost with less proficiency. Using Quantum Mechanics followed by Machine Learning (QM/ML) approach, we can predict the best catalyst faster way and the origin of the cause can be identified for further development of carbon-based catalyst. Using the π electronic descriptor unveiled using density functional theory, we applied the analytical simple fit method and six different machine learning algorithms to develop a highly effective predictive model to estimate ΔGOH. Furthermore, structural relations of ZGNR and AGNR are demonstrated to estimate the Dπ(EF), R-Oπ, and ΔGOH of different widths of ribbon that reduces additional DFT calculations. By applying both SVR predictive model and structural relations, we predicted the ORR performance of 2500 sites of GNRs and listed a few most ideal active carbon sites with lower overpotential (η < 0.5V). To validate our study, we predicted the ORR performance of different sites in 0D, 1D, 2D doped graphene systems using SVR model and confirmed the values with the DFT computed results.",Carbon
Achieving reaction pathway separation for electrochemical nitrate fixation on triatomic catalysts: A new mechanism,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.As the continuous development of electrocatalytic technique, the degradation of toxic nitrate wastewater into green fuel ammonia has become the goal of researcher's unremitting efforts by electrochemical method. Particularly, a high performance catalyst for electrochemical process is regarded as an indispensable tool for sustainable cycle. Although existing designed electrodes may effectively advance nitrate reduction reaction, they remain unsatisfactory due to elusive reaction processes. Here, a brand-new reaction mechanism has been proposed via density functional theory (DFT) and ab initio molecule dynamic (AIMD) methods, which breaks the bottleneck of linear scaling in atomic scale catalyst design. It is found that triple Mn atoms anchored on graphdiyne (Mn3-GDY) can drive nitrate adsorption and ammonia desorption on its surface with weak binding strength and strong activation by the spin polarization of active site. In addition, the powerful adsorption capacity of triatomic active site prevents the thermodynamic barrier from rising due to the transformation of the intermediates *NO3H and *NO2H into *NO2*OH and *NO*OH, respectively. More importantly, in accordance with the “weak-strong-weak” principle, Mn3-GDY has rapid response to ammonia desorption that is conducive to boost the turnover frequency. Anyway, this work may provide a new insight into atomic catalysts for improving reaction mechanisms.",Journal of Hazardous Materials
Pyrolysis-free and universal synthesis of metal-NC single-atom nanozymes with dual catalytic sites for cytoprotection,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdMetal-nitrogen-doped carbon single-atom nanozymes (M − NC SAzymes) have tremendous prospects to replace natural enzymes for the treatment of reactive oxygen species (ROS)-related diseases. However, developing a pyrolysis-free and universal synthesis of M − NC SAzymes with robust enzyme-mimicking activity still remains a challenge. Herein, a promising cytoprotective agent (Fe-NC SAzymes) with multiple enzyme-mimicking activities was fabricated based on the reaction of Schiff bases with Fe ions via one-pot solvothermal method. In Fe-NC SAzymes, Fe-Nx moieties served as the main catalytic sites to mimick oxidase, peroxidase, and catalase; meanwhile, the co-catalytic sites of the π-conjugated nitrogen-doped carbon structure mimicked superoxide dismutase to achieve the multiple enzyme-mimicking catalysis. Owing to the dual catalytic sites and pyrolysis-free synthesis strategy, Fe-NC SAzymes showed enhanced catalytic performance and excellent biocompatibility, which could scavenge excessive intracellular ROS to alleviate oxidative stress. The viability of cells subjected to oxidative stress recovered from 1.4% to 80.3% after Fe-NC SAzymes treatment, demonstrating an outstanding cytoprotective performance. Remarkably, this synthetic strategy can be expanded to other metal-NC SAzymes (Cu, Mn, Co, Zn, and Ni), which provides a feasible route to design specific functional SAzymes for ROS-related diseases therapy.",Carbon
Selective CO2 electroreduction to ethanol on encapsulated nickel nanoparticles by N-doped carbon nanotubes,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdThe electrosynthesis of ethanol by CO2 reduction is mostly achieved on metallic copper electrocatalysts, but confronts low Faradic efficiency (FE) and selectivity. Herein, we report novel electrocatalysts in which Ni nanoparticles are encapsulated in N-rich carbon nanotubes (Ni@NCNT) by chemical vapor deposition method. The optimized Ni@NCNT-700 exhibits a high ethanol FE of 38.5% at −0.5 V and remains over 30% in a wide potential range of −0.5 ∼ −1.2 V. Notably, ethanol is the only liquid product and the total FE for CO and ethanol keeps above 90% in a potential range of −0.6 ∼ −1.2 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode. A high current density of 128 mA cm−2 is obtained in a 1 M KOH electrolyte at −2.0 V in a flow-cell device. Moreover, In-situ Raman and density functional theory calculations demonstrate that the confinement and synergistic effects of Ni NPs and NCNTs sufficiently lower the energy barrier for C–C coupling and suppressed the *CO desorption.",Carbon
Bimetallic ordered carbonaceous frameworks from Co- and Cu-porphyrin bimolecular crystals,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdOrdered carbonaceous frameworks (OCFs) are unique carbon alloys, having the advantages of both organic-based nanoporous frameworks and carbon materials: well-defined ordered structures, single-atom sites, high thermal/chemical stability, and electrical conductivity. Compared with reported carbon-metal catalysts with single-atom sites, OCFs contains a large amount of single-atomic metals (∼9 wt%), making OCFs a promising platform for various applications including electrocatalysis and energy storage/conversion. However, the types of metal species incorporated into OCFs have been limited to Ni and Fe. Herein, we demonstrate the synthesis of OCFs with single-atomic Co- and Cu-sites from the corresponding porphyrin crystals with eight ethynyl moieties. Since the Co- and Cu-porphyrin precursors have identical molecular structures except the metal species, they form identical supramolecular crystals. Thus, it is possible to form bimetallic supramolecular crystals simply by recrystallization of these two molecules together, and the resulting bimetallic crystals can be converted into bimetallic OCFs with developed microporosity. In the frameworks of the OCFs, single-atomic Co and Cu species are homogeneously dispersed and immobilized. The metal species embedded in the OCF framework are electrochemically active, and synergetic effect of Co and Cu in close proximity is observed.",Carbon
Defect-stabilized platinum single atoms and clusters in bilayer nitrogen-doped porous carbon nanocages for synergistic catalysis of basic hydrogen evolution,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdAlkaline water electrolysis is a safe and efficient method for producing hydrogen that is favored by the industry. At present, single-atom catalysts have attracted extensive attention due to their extremely high atom utilization. However, studies on the single-atom site catalytic mechanism of the Volmer step, the rate-determining step of the cathodic HER reaction, are lacking. Here, we used ZIF-8 to obtain double-layer N-doped porous carbon nanocages, and successfully achieved the co-loading of Pt single atoms and their clusters (NPCN–Pt). The turnover frequency (TOF) and mass activity of NPCN–Pt are 5 and 7.2 times higher than those of commercial Pt/C, respectively, and the former exhibits significantly better stability than Pt/C. Theoretical calculations show that Pt clusters have a lower activation energy barrier for water molecules compared to Pt single atoms, which favors the Volmer step. The ΔGH* of Pt single-atom sites is smaller than that of Pt clusters, which is more conducive to the release of H2. The study shows that Pt clusters and single atoms can synergistically catalyze the HER reaction, providing new ideas for the development of efficient HER catalysts.",Carbon
Surface-confined polymerization to construct binary Fe3N/Co–N–C encapsulated MXene composites for high-performance zinc-air battery,"© 2022 Elsevier Ltd2D MXenes (transition metal carbides, Ti3C2Tx) with large surface area and metallic conductivity are widely used as supporters in catalysts. Unfortunately, the single MXene sheets would deteriorate in the presence of oxygen and water, which is almost the same as the environment of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Herein, an “armor” was constructed to encapsulate the oxidizable MXene by a confined in-situ oxidative polymerization strategy, employing the electrostatic interaction between the exfoliated MXene sheets (negatively charged) and oxidant (Fe3+, positively charged). The ultra-dispersed binary Fe3N and Co sits coupled with the large surface area MXene supporter synergy to endow more exposed active sites, meanwhile, the density functional theory (DFT) studies reveal that a moderate binding strength between the intermediates and the binary active sites was effectively modulated to enhance the ORR performance. The synthesized Fe3N/Co–N–C@MXene exhibits an impressive half-wave potential (E1/2, 0.871V) and a lower Tafel slope of 52.56 mV dec−1 than that of Pt–C-20% (74.89 mV dec−1). The Fe3N/Co–N–C@MXene based ZAB exhibits a four times higher peak power density (189.16 mW cm−2) than the Pt–C-20% based ZABs and superior cycle stability within 320 h. Furthermore, the assembled flexible ZABs shows high flexibility and stability in different bending scenarios.",Carbon
Efficient adsorption removal of NO2 by covalent triazine frameworks with fine-tuned binding sites,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.One promising method for mitigating low-temperature and low-concentration NO2 pollution is selective adsorption using porous solid materials. However, the corrosive nature of NO2 renders the development of an adsorbent with high and cyclable NO2 uptake a formidable challenge. Herein, we attempted to address this challenge by developing a microporous covalent triazine framework (CTF) as effective adsorbents for NO2 capture, achieving unprecedented high cyclable capacity enabled by simultaneous high adsorbent stability and moderate adsorption affinity via tuning specific binding sites. Using dynamic column breakthrough experiments, we demonstrated that the pristine CTF exhibited a high NO2 adsorption capacity (dry: 3.83 mmol/g; wet: 5.26 mmol/g) overtaking most reported solid adsorbents, thanks to abundant active sites (e.g., nitrogen/carbon/triazine rings). Post-synthesis converted the surface nitrogen to protonated nitrogen site and further to transition metal site affording more effective binding sites that allows for moderately strong adsorption, resulting in elevated NO2 adsorption capacity (dry: 6.11 mmol/g; wet: 8.97 mmol/g) and a highest reversible NO2 adsorption (retaining 91 % and 64 % at dry and wet conditions after five cycles, respectively), as illustrated by our mechanistic study using in situ DRIFTS and DFT calculations. This work affords not only promising adsorbents for real-world applications in mitigating NO2 pollution, but also a strategy of developing robust adsorbents with desired affinity generally applicable to adsorptive capture of corrosive and toxic gases.",Journal of Hazardous Materials
Electrochemically exfoliated Ni-doped MoS2 nanosheets for highly efficient hydrogen evolution and Zn-H2O battery,"© 2022Thanks to tunable physical and chemical properties, two-dimensional (2D) materials have received intensive interest, endowing their excellent electrocatalytic performances for applications in energy conversion. However, their catalytic activities are largely determined by poor adsorption energy and limited active edge sites. Herein, a one-step electrochemical exfoliation strategy was developed to fabricate 2D Ni-doped MoS2 nanosheets (Ni-EX-MoS2) with a lateral size of ∼500 nm and thickness of ∼3.5 nm. Profiting from high electrical conductivity and abundant exposing active sites, Ni-EX-MoS2 catalyst displayed an admirable performance for electrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) with a low overpotential of 145 mV at 10 mA/cm2 as well as a small Tafel slope of 89 mV/dec in alkaline media, which are superior to those of the most reported MoS2-based electrocatalysts. The formed Ni species with tuning electronic structure played a crucial role as primary active center of Ni-EX-MoS2, as well as the forming stable 1T/2H phase MoS2 interface demonstrated a synergistic effect on electrocatalytic HER performance. Further, Ni-EX-MoS2 was employed as a cathode electrode for alkaline Zn-H2O battery, which displayed a high power density of 3.3 mW/cm2 with excellent stability. This work will provide a simple and effective guideline for design of electrochemically exfoliated transition metal-doped MoS2 nanosheets to inspire their practical applications in energy catalytic and storage.",Chinese Chemical Letters

Herein, Fe3O4/N-rGO nanocomposites were successfully synthesized with one-pot hydrothermal method and constructed a novel electrochemical sensor for detection of CAP. The experimental results showed that the Fe3O4/N-rGO modified electrode exhibited excellent detection performance for CAP with the linear range of 1–200 μM and a low detection limit of 0.03 μM. The proposed sensor also showed good selectivity, reproducibility, stability and successfully applied for the CAP determination present in milk products with the recovery rate of 96.70 %–103.55 %. This study provides a promising development direction for CAP detection.",Materials Letters
Vacancy-enhanced Mo-N2 interaction in MoSe2 nanosheets enables efficient electrocatalytic NH3 synthesis,"© 2022NH3 plays an essential role in human life since it is an important raw material for fertilizers, plastics and rubbers production. As an NH3 synthesis technology under ambient conditions, electrocatalytic N2 reduction reaction (NRR) has great potential to replace the energy-intensive Haber-Bosch process. The key of electrocatalytic NRR is the exploration of efficient catalysts. Transition metal Mo is promising since it exists naturally in nitrogenase due to the unique Mo-N2 interaction; particularly in the form of 2D material such as MoSe2, the surface area is maximized for more active sites. However, the NRR performance of MoSe2 is still unsatisfactory because Mo is only exposed at the semi-open edge, and the electronegative Se-mantled surface area remains inaccessible to N2. Herein, we propose a simple and effective strategy to create high-concentration Se vacancies in MoSe2 through heteroatom doping induced lattice strain, which effectively enhances the Mo-N2 interaction on the surface area. In result, high NH3 yield (3.04 × 10–10 mol s–1 cm–2) and Faraday efficiency (21.61%) are attained at –0.45 V vs. RHE in 0.1 mol/L Na2SO4.",Chinese Chemical Letters
Electrochemical nitrogen fixation in metal-N2 batteries: A paradigm for simultaneous NH3 synthesis and energy generation,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Electrochemical N2 reduction reaction (NRR) has emerged as the most effective alternative to the conventional Haber-Bosch process for N2 fixation. Although NRR is only used in the synthesis of NH3, researchers have recently exploited it in Metal-N2 batteries (hereafter, M-N2 batteries) to kill two birds with one stone by fixing N2 and generating electricity at the same time. There are three types of electrochemical energy storage approaches, namely rechargeable with irreversible electrochemical reaction (under aqueous or non-aqueous conditions), non-rechargeable with irreversible electrochemical reaction (under aqueous conditions), and rechargeable with reversible electrochemical reaction (under non-aqueous conditions). However, the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in an aqueous medium takes precedence over the NRR, resulting in a poor Faradic efficiency (FE) for the NRR selectivity. This obvious but unwanted HER causes the low conversion efficiency in aqueous M-N2 batteries. Furthermore, the instability of cathode electrocatalysts causes a significant drop in the overall performance of M-N2 batteries. Despite these flaws, M-N2 batteries represent the first step toward simultaneous N2 fixation and energy storage. Herein, we comprehensively review the NRR mechanism, electrochemistry, and performances of M-N2 batteries. With an emphasis on the strategies to design highly efficient cathode catalysts and electrolytes for future M-N2 batteries, we also chronicle the strategies to suppress the undesired HER in M-N2 batteries. Furthermore, based on the photoelectrochemical NRR and solar-powered metal-gas batteries, a future outlook on photo-assisted M-N2 batteries is also provided.",Energy Storage Materials
Polyaniline coated Pt/CNT as highly stable and active catalyst for catalytic hydrogenation reduction of Cr(VI),"© 2022 Elsevier LtdLiquid phase catalytic hydrogenation reduction is a feasible method to eliminate Cr(VI) in water, while supported noble metal catalysts are liable to deactivation. In this study, carbon nanotube supported Pt catalyst (Pt/CNT) coated by polyaniline (Pt/CNT@PANI) was prepared and applied in the liquid phase catalytic hydrogenation of Cr(VI). Characterization results disclose that after coating Pt/CNT is completely wrapped by PANI layers and active Pt particles are no longer accessible. Despite complete embedment of Pt particles by PANI layers, Pt/CNT@PANI remains highly active for Cr(VI) reduction in liquid phase catalytic hydrogenation. The catalytic Cr(VI) reduction on Pt/CNT@PANI can be described by a PANI oxidation-reduction mechanism, by which PANI is first oxidized by Cr(VI) to form Cr(III), and oxidized PANI is reduced by catalytic hydrogenation. The Cr(VI) reduction on Pt/CNT@PANI complies with the Langmuir-Hinshelwood model, reflecting the pivotal role of Cr(VI) adsorption. Furthermore, the catalytic activity of Pt/CNT@PANI differs with PANI layer thickness and Cr(VI) reduction is positively correlated with reaction temperature. Catalyst recycling results show that after 4 cycles Pt/CNT loses 92.4% of catalytic activity, while the initial activity of Pt/CNT@PANI slightly decreases by 11.6%, demonstrating its high catalyst stability.",Chemosphere
Anchoring the late first row transition metals with B12P12 nanocage to act as single atom catalysts toward oxygen evolution reaction (OER),"© 2022 Elsevier LtdThe high over-potential associated with water splitting hinders the wide production of hydrogen and oxygen gases. Recent advancements in this field are being made by exploring novel, low-cost and highly efficient catalysts to lower the over-potential of the water splitting reaction. Herein, we studied the novel single atom catalysts (SACs) based on late first-row transition metal doped boron phosphide (B12P12) nano-cages for the electrocatalysis of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) via density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The choice of using boron phosphide nano-cages as the support is based on the highly desirable properties within it. Namely, having many defects, excellent electrical conductivity, large surface area, and high chemical stability. The Ni@B12P12 and Co@B12P12 SACs exhibit high chemical stability, having interaction energies of −1.70 and −2.55 eV, respectively. Moreover, the results of quantum theory of atoms in molecules (QTAIM) analysis confirmed that the transition metals are covalently chemisorbed on the nano-cages, such strong interactions are desirable in SACs to ensure they withstand harsh chemical environments and are active for longer time period. Frontier molecular orbitals (FMOs) analysis indicates that the designed catalysts have semi-conducting capabilities which facilitate the transfer of electrons.

A comprehensive DFT evaluation of catalytic and optoelectronic properties of BaTiO3 polymorphs,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.BaTiO3 exhibits promising photocatalytic characteristics and has the potential to be employed in photocatalytic water splitting and pollutant degradation. Herein, we have investigated the structural, electronic, and optical properties of BaTiO3 in the framework of density functional theory (DFT). The obtained results are found to be consistent with theoretical results. However, using hybrid HSE06 functional, the calculated bandgap values are 3.254, 3.894, 3.694, 3.519, and 3.388 eV corresponding to cubic, rhombohedral, orthorhombic, tetragonal, and hexagonal phase of BaTiO3 polymorphs. This is the first time a DFT calculation touched over the experimental bandgap values of BaTiO3 polymorphs. Electronic band structure analysis revealed that all the BaTiO3 polymorphs exhibit semiconducting character with indirect bandgap except hexagonal structure which possesses direct bandgap. The density of states (DOS), Mulliken bond analysis and charge density distribution indicates considerable hybridization between O-2p and Ti-3d states caused to the formation of upper valence band (VB) and lower conduction band (CB). The wide bandgap and suitable redox potential of BaTiO3 polymorphs will be effective for water splitting as well as breakdown organic contaminants under UV–vis irradiation. The lower electron effective mass of the polymorphs indicates higher electrical conductivity. The energy dependent optical parameters show close agreement with the underlying electronic band structure. The high absorptivity, lower reflectivity and optical anisotropy (orthorhombic and tetragonal) of the polymorphs suggested that these could be a potential candidate for UV based optical device applications as well as to design wave guides, dielectric condensers and optical display devices.",Physica B: Condensed Matter
Single-atom Co-N5 catalytic sites on carbon nanotubes as peroxymonosulfate activator for sulfamerazine degradation via enhanced electron transfer pathway,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Carbon-based single-atom cobalt catalysts exhibit high catalytic activity for the removal of novel pollutants in advanced oxidation processes. Here, atomically dispersed Co species with five-coordinated nitrogen atoms on carbon nanotubes (CNT) catalyst (Co-N5/CNT) was successfully fabricated via a low-temperature solvothermal reaction. The obtained Co-N5/CNT catalyst exhibited superior catalytic performance for PMS activation for sulfamerazine degradation. Its apparent rate constant kobs was 1.6 times higher than that of the Co-N4/CNT catalyst with four-coordinated nitrogen atoms prepared by the same method. Electron transfer non-radical mechanism was the main pathway for Co-N5/CNT to activate PMS. Higher single-atom cobalt metal loading (1.39 wt% vs 1.08 wt% in Co-N4/CNT) and significantly enhanced electron transfer ability (0.82 e vs 0.77 e in Co-N4/CNT) were the key factors for its superior catalytic performance. This work demonstrates a novel carbon-based single-atom cobalt catalyst for the removal of novel antibiotic contaminants by activating PMS in environmental catalysis applications.",Separation and Purification Technology
Making cathode composites more efficient for electro-fenton and bio-electro-fenton systems: A review,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Electro-Fenton (E-Fenton) and Bio-Electro-Fenton (BEF) technologies have been proved to be efficient in undegradable pollutants purification. However, various limitations, such as stringent pH control, excessive iron-producing sludge, and poor stabilities, are always the key issues that prevent E-Fenton and BEF systems from being widely deployed in environmental remediation. As a result, various studies have been done to solve these drawbacks and this review focuses on the critical issue of cathode composites. First, the hotspots and research fronts of E-Fenton and BEF technologies were revealed by the keyword clusters obtained by CiteSpace software, and then the main influencing parameters shared by E-Fenton and BEF systems were analyzed. In view of the above results, the composite composition was divided into two parts: substrate materials and heterogeneous Fenton/Fenton-like catalysts. Following that, the mechanisms and improved methods of oxygen reduction electrocatalysis materials (e.g., surface functional groups, heteroatom doping) as well as advances in heterogeneous Fenton/Fenton-like in E-Fenton and BEF systems are summarized, with a view to developing effective cathode composites. Finally, the state development status and prospects of cathode composites are investigated in the hope that they will be useful in the future development of E-Fenton and BEF processes.",Separation and Purification Technology
Stabilized N coordinated Cu site in catalytic ozonation: The efficient generation of [rad]OH induced by surface hydroxyl groups based on the Lewis acid site,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Simultaneously maintaining perfect activity and stability of materials in catalytic ozonation system has always been an insurmountable challenge. Embedding metal ions in g-C3N4 in the form of coordination bonds made it possible, because the distinctive tri-s-triazine structure of g-C3N4 was beneficial to the expose of active sites and fixation of metal ions. A Cu doped g-C3N4 material was synthesized by a simple pyrolysis method. The material presented a 16 times enhancement of rate constants in comparison with ozonation and high stability with limited Cu leaching in the catalytic ozonation system. Owing to the positive linear relationship between Cu-N contents and rate constants, the Cu-N active site was revealed. Unexpectedly, the Cu-N site as the Lewis acid site did not directly catalyze O3 to generate [rad]OH, but relied on the surface hydroxyl groups to carry out according to the experimental and theoretical studies. It differed from the traditional catalytic path of the Lewis acid site. Finally, a novel catalytic mechanism that the Cu-N site as the Lewis acid site induced the surface hydroxyl groups, thus promoting the generation of [rad]OH by catalyzing O3 was proposed. This work would provide a new way to optimize and modify the materials equipped with Lewis acid site in catalytic ozonation system.",Separation and Purification Technology
Synthesis and application of single-atom catalysts in sulfur cathode for high-performance lithium–sulfur batteries,"© 2022Lithium–sulfur (Li-S) batteries are regarded as one of the most promising energy storage devices because of their low cost, high energy density, and environmental friendliness. However, Li-S batteries suffer from sluggish reaction kinetics and serious “shuttle effect” of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs), which causes rapid decay of battery capacity and prevent their practical application. To address these problems, introducing single-atom catalysts (SACs) is an effective method to improve the electrochemical performance of Li-S batteries, due to their high catalytic efficiency and definite active sites for LiPSs. In this paper, we summarized the latest developments in enhancing the electrochemical performance of cathode for Li-S batteries through introducing different SACs. Furthermore, we briefly introduced the catalytic mechanism of SACs and discussed the strategies of synthesizing SACs, including the spatial confinement strategy and the coordination design strategy. Finally, the challenges and prospects in this field are proposed. We believe that this review would help to design and fabricate high-performance Li-S batteries via introducing SACs and boost their practical application.",Chinese Chemical Letters

Engineering the electronic structure of high performance FeCo bimetallic cathode catalysts for microbial fuel cell application in treating wastewater,"© 2022 Elsevier Inc.The development of high-performance, strong-durability and low-cost cathode catalysts toward oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is of great significance for microbial fuel cells (MFCs). In this study, a series of bimetallic catalysts were synthesized by pyrolyzing a mixture of g-C3N4 and Fe, Co-tannic complex with various Fe/Co atomic ratios. The initial Fe/Co atomic ratio (3.5:0.5, 3:1, 2:2, 1:3) could regulate the electronic state, which effectively promoted the intrinsic electrocatalytic ORR activity. The alloy metal particles and metal-Nx sites presented on the catalyst surface. In addition, N-doped carbon interconnected network consisting of graphene-like and bamboo-like carbon nanotube structure derived from g-C3N4 provided more accessible active sites. The resultant Fe3Co1 catalyst calcined at 700 °C (Fe3Co1-700) exhibited high catalytic performance in neutral electrolyte with a half-wave potential of 0.661 V, exceeding that of the commercial Pt/C (0.6 V). As expected, the single chamber microbial fuel cell (SCMFC) with 1 mg/cm2 loading of Fe3Co1-700 catalyst as the cathode catalyst afforded a maximum power density of 1425 mW/m2, which was 10.5% higher than commercial Pt/C catalyst with the same loading (1290 mW/m2) and comparable to the Pt/C catalyst with 2.5 times higher loading ( 1430 mW/m2). Additionally, the Fe3Co1-700 also displayed better long-term stability over 1100 h than the Pt/C. This work provides an effective strategy for regulating the surface electronic state in the bimetallic electro-catalyst.",Environmental Research

Boron has been found to be a key functional component for designing high-performance heterogeneous catalysts. In this review, we cover and categorize the past and recent progress in boron-containing materials and their applications in heterogeneous catalysis particularly in energy‐related fields. The fundamental roles of boron components in the emerging heterogeneous catalysis of construction, regulation and stabilization of active phases/sites are highlighted, with the emphasis on how they regulating structural and electronic properties of host materials.

The catalytic applications of these six boron-containing catalysts are discussed separately, focusing on the energy-related reactions such as hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) and nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR). Finally, the opportunities and challenges related to boron-containing compounds in the field of catalysis are prospected.",Chinese Chemical Letters
Mn-N-P doped carbon spheres as an efficient oxygen reduction catalyst for high performance Zn-Air batteries,"© 2022Low-cost and efficient oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) electrocatalysts are the key to developing Zn-air batteries for renewable energy storage. Herein, the Mn-N-P doped carbon sphere was prepared through polymerization of hexachlorotripolyphosphazene (HCCP) and phloroglucinol, and then followed the calcination at 900 °C. Theory calculations demonstrated the introduction of Mn in N-P doped carbon could lower the dissociation barrier of O2 into O* and promote the ORR through a 4e− pathway. The as-prepared catalysts exhibited a half-wave potential of 0.82 V vs. RHE and limiting current density of 5.2 mA/cm2 toward ORR, which was comparable to those of the commercial Pt/C catalysts. In addition, Zn-air batteries with 0.05 Mn-N-P-C catalysts showed a high specific capacity of 830 mAh/gZn and excellent cycle stability. This facile approach demonstrated herein could be a solution to develop optimum non-precious metal catalysts for the application in cathodes of proton exchange membrane fuel cells.

Water splitting performance of metal and non-metal-doped transition metal oxide electrocatalysts,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Transition metal oxide electrocatalysts have received significant research interest toward the advancement of environmentally acceptable electrochemical applications and systems, which are considered to be promising technologies due to their unique physicochemical properties like low cost, robust durability, structural flexibility, and tunable activity. However, transition metal oxide-based electrocatalysts suffer from poor electrocatalytic activity as well as a limited number of active sites, which result in the obstruction of their applications over the world. To overcome these challenges, heteroatom-doping into transition metal oxide electrocatalysts has been a crucial and rapid way to improve the conductivity of the catalytic centers and optimize the adsorption of the reactants and intermediates during the catalytic process, and hence, their electrocatalytic activity, which has become widespread in nanomaterials, is offering the possibility to select the catalytic properties with attractive traits for a specific application to some extent. We have critically and systematically discussed the recent progress on doping strategy involves non-noble metallic elements, such as Fe, Co, Mn, Ni, Ru, Mo, W, Cu, etc., and non–metallic elements, such as S, N, P, B, Se, F, C, etc., in transition metal oxide-based electrocatalysts for water splitting performance to gain a better understanding of the relationship between effect of heteroatoms doping engineering techniques and TMOs catalytic properties. Most importantly, doping, elemental incorporation and alloying perform a significant role with heteroatoms for improving the catalytic activity on; modifying the electronic configuration of the catalysts, increasing the number of active sites, enhancing the electrical conductivity, and inducing synergistic effect of the transition metal oxide-based electrocatalysts during overall water splitting process. We here also have briefly described the techniques used for preparing metal and non-metal-doped transition metal oxide-based electrocatalysts for overall water splitting process. In nutshell, this review is expected to provide a deeper insight on the effect of the metal and non-metal-doping in transition metal oxide-based electrocatalysts for the rational design of high-performance catalysts in the future.

"Renewable wood-derived hierarchical porous, N-doped carbon sheet as a robust self-supporting cathodic electrode for zinc-air batteries","© 2022Heteroatom doped porous carbon materials have emerged as essential cathode material for metal-air battery systems in the context of soaring demands for clean energy conversion and storage. Herein, a three-dimensional nitrogen-doped carbon self-supported electrode (TNCSE) is fabricated through thermal treatment and acid activation of raw wood. The resulting TNCSE retains the hierarchical porous architecture of parent raw lumber and holds substantial defect sites and doped N sites in the carbon skeleton.

Atom hybridization of metallic elements: Emergence of subnano metallurgy for the post-nanotechnology,"© 2022 The AuthorsMiniaturizing metallic materials from the nanoscale to the atomic scale transforms the structures and physical properties. Among these sub-nanoscale materials, some catalysts exhibit activity superior to conventional nanoparticle catalysts. Furthermore, some subnanoparticles become superatoms that exhibit unusual physical properties that deviate from the properties of the original elements. However, conventional metallurgy and chemistry often do not apply to synthetic strategies, structural analysis, and functional design of materials because crystal structures disappear at the sub-nanoscale.

Emerging multifunctional iron-based nanomaterials as polysulfides adsorbent and sulfur species catalyst for lithium-sulfur batteries—A mini-review,"© 2022Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) battery has been considered as one of the most promising next generation energy storage technologies for its overwhelming merits of high theoretical specific capacity (1673 mAh/g), high energy density (2500 Wh/kg), low cost, and environmentally friendliness of sulfur. However, critical drawbacks, including inherent low conductivity of sulfur and Li2S, large volume changes of sulfur cathodes, undesirable shuttling and sluggish redox kinetics of polysulfides, seriously deteriorate the energy density, cycle life and rate capability of Li-S battery, and thus limit its practical applications.

Tuning the catalytic activity of Ag7Au6 cluster for oxygen reduction reaction via support interactions,"© 2022 Elsevier Inc.We investigate the suitability as oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalysts of Ag7Au6 clusters supported by nitrogen-doped graphene (N–graphene) sheets with two different nitrogen contents (3.61% and 8.43%), as well as TiO2(101) monolayers, using post–DFT methods. We employ two energetic descriptors (namely, the O2 and OH binding energies and O–O bond length), to compare the effect of two different supports on the catalytic activity of the Ag7Au6 cluster. We find that low adsorption energies for O2 (approximately −1 eV) and OH (below the one of its reaction on Pt), and O–O bond elongation (which reaches up to 1.34 Å in our study, corresponding to the superoxide bond length) cause the high ORR activity of our materials of interest. Our results show that the supported clusters have higher catalytic performance compared to the unsupported ones due to the lower binding energies of the O2 and OH molecules. Moreover, the TiO2(101) monolayer is a better support for the Ag7Au6 cluster, due to the O–O bond distance increasing up to 1.33 Å, facilitating O2 dissociation. In addition, the low (−0.35 eV) OH adsorption energy decreases the difficulty of OH removal. Through free energy calculations, we prove the ORR mechanism in acidic conditions to display an over-potential of −1.76 V, competitive with to the ones featured by currently available catalysts.",Journal of Molecular Graphics and Modelling

Enhanced photocatalytic activity of MoS2 via N + F codoping and strain engineering: A first-principles investigation,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.The inert basal plane severely limited the catalytic activity of MoS2 monolayer. Therefore, activating the catalytic inert basal plane is a great challenge. Here, two strategies, N + F codoping and strain engineering, are proposed to improve the photocatalytic activity of MoS2 monolayer utilizing the first-principles calculation. The Gibbs free energy change (ΔGH = -0.081 eV) for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) of N + F codoped MoS2 monolayer indicates the distinctly enhanced HER activity compared with pristine MoS2 monolayer (ΔGH = 2.087 eV). The LUMO and HOMO reveal that MoS2 monolayer with N + F codoping possesses the more catalytic active sites. Additionally, the ratio of the effective mass (2.32) in N + F codoped MoS2 predicts a higher photoexcited carriers separation efficiency than in MoS2 (1.18). The N + F codoped MoS2 owns decent band-edge positions with the compressive strain of 2 %, demonstrating the enhanced photocatalytic properties. This work theoretically proposes N + F codoping and applying strain MoS2 monolayer exhibits promising application potential in the field of photocatalytic overall water splitting. These results expect to provide guidance and reference for the experimental elevating the highly active photocatalytic performance of MoS2 monolayer from the theoretical aspect.",Applied Surface Science
Axial O-ligand induced high ORR activity over Mo and N codoped graphene: A computational mechanism study,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.The catalytic activity of single metal atom were effectively enhanced by different coordination environments, and the underlying improvement mechanisms are generally ascribed to the electronic structure modification by in-plane ligands. Herein, taking the recently synthesized MoNO composites modified carbon as representative, we clarified the multiple functions of axial oxygen ligand in improving the oxygen reduction activity. The active Mo atom is protruded from graphene plane due to the interaction with axial oxygen ligand, and during adsorption of oxygenates, the hanging oxygen ligand would wag to leave space and meanwhile tune the orbital orientation of Mo atom, giving rise to an optimal adsorption strength on the side in presence of oxygen ligand. The dynamic oxygen ligand may participate in the catalysis through hydrogenation reaction at the coadsorption stage with oxygen intermediate. The obtained overpotential of 0.35 V on MoN2O1-pen-gra along homolateral adsorbate evolution mechanism is comparable to recent experiments, approving the reliability of models and mechanism proposed in current study. The present results could provide some new insights into the functions of axial ligands and further guide the rational design of axial coordination to improve the catalytic performance.",Surface Science

Herein, we present a systematic study of a nanostructured Pt99Ni1/TiN NTs@NC catalyst for MOR, synthesized by a process concluding solvothermal, chelation, post-nitriding, and ethylene glycol reduction. The simultaneous production of TiN NTs@NC and Ni nanoclusters was obtained from the Ni/TiO2 NTs@PDA complexes derived from Ni-MOF and its pyrolysis under NH3 annealing process. The Ni/TiN NTs@NC substrate is in possession of a mesoporous nanotubes structure with unique sharp nanothorns on surface owing to the usage of Ni-MOF as precursor, resulting in the homogeneous distribution and intimate contact of Ni nanoclusters on the TiN NTs@NC substrate. The unique nanostructure, formation of open active diffusion channels and a large number of accessible active sites on supports provided an opportunity for nucleation and growth of PtNi alloys, leading to the improved metal-support interaction. The formation of PtNi alloys with small size and well-dispersion view not only improves the synergistic effect of electronics and strain but also weakens interaction between Pt and intermediate. Benefiting from above advantages, the Pt99Ni1/TiN NTs@NC exhibits superior MOR performance with enhanced catalytic activity, remarkable CO-resilient capacity, and excellent stability.",Applied Surface Science

Since CO2 emission levels have been incessantly on the upsurge, the conversion of CO2 to value-added chemical products like methane, methanol, ethanol, olefins, heterocycles, oligomers, etc. is gaining significant prominence. Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs) owing to their characteristic features like tunable porosity, structural uniformity, and higher internal surface area are known to accelerate several reactions of high interest that even surpass the shortcomings associated with homogeneous catalysts. Herein, the recent trends and advancements for CO2 conversion to value-added products are comprehensively deliberated that exploit the specific MOFs-based nanocatalysts for the conversion of CO2 using different methods like photocatalysis, electrocatalysis, photoelectrocatalysis, hydrogenation, the cycloaddition of epoxides with CO2, and carboxylation of terminal alkynes with CO2. In addition, special emphasis is given to the relationship between CO2 capture capacity and catalytic activity of the MOFs-based nanocomposites developed in recent years (2015–2022). The entire compendium of literature chronicles their exceptional competence in the conversion of CO2, making these nanocomposites promising candidates for real-world applications.

Enhanced electro-activity of nickel phosphide by pre-treatment for efficient hydrogen sulfide elimination,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Electrochemical sulfide oxidation is a promising approach for sulfide removal from wastewater or biogas due to low energy and chemical consumption. In this work, nickel phosphide was facilely electrodeposited on stainless steel (SS/Ni-P) and comprehensively evaluated as anode catalyst for sulfide oxidation. Electrochemical property analysis suggested that SS/Ni-P had low polarization resistance (109.10 Ω) and high electrochemical active surface area (Cdl = 1.3 mF/cm2). The sulfide removal efficiency of SS/Ni-P achieved 95.00 ± 3.55 % at 1.42 V vs RHE within 48 h, which was 2.60 times and 3.62 times of that by SS/Ni and SS anodes, respectively. The first order kinetic rate constant of SS/Ni-P for sulfide removal was 0.0315 ± 0.0061 h-1, superior than that of the reported single nickel atom based catalyst with stainless steel substrate. Pre-treating SS/Ni-P under a constant external potential for 10 s further improved the electroactivity on sulfide oxidation due to the enhancement of the electrochemical active surface area by 46.56%. Further analysis of the chemical state changes during the sulfide oxidation process revealed that the Ni from Ni-P was the real active center, which formed Ni-S precursors to promote polysulfide formation. This work provided a highly efficient sulfide oxidation anode material for sulfide containing wastewater and biogas treatment.",Applied Surface Science
Utilizing the cross-linked effect and reconstruction strategy of phytic acid to build Fe-Co-Ni trimetallic amorphous carbon-matrix compounds as efficient oxygen evolution catalyst,"© 2022 Elsevier Inc.Developing low-cost electrocatalysts with excellent activity is significant for accelerating the slow oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In this work, an effective electrocatalyst is prepared via the cross-linked effect and reconstruction strategy based on inexpensive transition metals (Fe, Co, and Ni) and phytic acid (PA). The feasibility of utilizing the cross-linked effect and reconstruction strategy is due to that PA molecules with strongly electronegative phosphoric acid groups possess a great deal of complexing sites, which can facilitate the formation of large cross-linked network by randomly complexing Fe, Co and Ni ions. And the carboatomic rings in PA molecules will reconstructed as carbon-matrix when PA molecules decompose. The above structural evolution of large cross-linked network and reconstructing process is rigorously analyzed through the characterization methods such as XPS. These analysis results indicate that FeCoNi-PA-300 possesses a high degree of amorphization, an abundant nanoporous structure, and a small nanoparticle size, resulting in a large electrochemically active area. Consequently, FeCoNi-PA-300 just needs low overpotentials of about 271 mV and 286 mV to obtain the current densities of 50 and 100 mA cm−2, respectively. Meaningfully, this synthetic method is a general strategy to meliorate the OER activity and electrical conductivity of other catalysts.",Journal of Colloid and Interface Science
Single-step salt-template-based scalable production of 2D carbon sheets heterostructured with nickel nanocatalysts for lowering overpotential of hydrogen evolution reaction,"© 2022 Elsevier Inc.Non-precious metals have been considered as suitable alternatives for high-performance hydrogen evolution reactions (HER). Although the incorporation of carbon substances is shown to improve the number of active sites, electron transfer pathways, and long-term stability, there have been rare reports on their single-step scalable production. Herein, we realize free-standing two-dimensional (2D) carbon sheets heterostructured with nickel (Ni) nanocatalysts by pyrolyzing ultrathin layers of acetate tetrahydrate (i.e. the single precursor for both Ni and C sources) over water-soluble salt crystals. Such a salt-templated methodology is environmentally friendly and readily scalable without the implementation of sophisticated equipment. The resulting 2D carbon sheets exhibit an average small thickness of ∼ 3 nm and lateral dimensions with tens of micrometers, where a large number of nano-sized Ni particles with an average diameter of 14 nm are uniformly dispersed. Such 2D Ni-C sheets demonstrate a small overpotential of 111 mV at 10 mA/cm2 and a low Tafel slope of 86 mV/dec for HER in 1 M KOH, which is significantly improved over those of reported non-precious metals composited with carbon substances.

Integrating electronic structure regulation and dynamic active sites construction on NixCd1-xS-Ni0 photocatalyst for efficient hydrogen evolution,"© 2022 Elsevier Inc.Regulating electronic structure and enriching active sites of photocatalysts are effective strategies to promote hydrogen evolution. Herein, a unique NixCd1-xS-Ni0 photocatalyst, including the surface nickel (Ni) doping and atomic Ni0 anchoring sites, is successfully prepared by Ni2+ ions exchange reaction (Ni2+ + CdS → NixCd1-xS) and in-situ photo-induction of Ni0 (Ni2++NixCd1-xS→hνNixCd1-xS-Ni0), respectively. As to Ni doping, the Ni replaced cadmium (Cd) atoms introduce hybridized states around the Fermi level, modulating the electronic structure of adjacent S atoms and optimizing the photocatalytic activity of sulfur (S) atoms. Besides, photogenerated Ni0 atoms, anchored on unsaturated S atoms, act as charge transfer bridges to reduce Ni2+ ions in the solution to Ni clusters (NixCd1-xS-Ni0→ne-NixCd1-xS-Ni). Subsequently, the displacement reaction of Ni clusters with protons (H+) spontaneously proceeds to produce hydrogen (H2) in an acidic solution (NixCd1-xS-Ni→2H+H2↑+Ni2++NixCd1-xS-Ni0). The equilibrium of photo-deposition/dissolution of Ni clusters realizes the construction of dynamic active sites, providing sustainable reaction centers and enhancing surface redox kinetics. The NixCd1-xS-Ni0 exhibits a high hydrogen evolution rate of 428 mmol·h−1·g−1 with a quantum efficiency of 75.6 % at 420 nm. This work provides the optimal S electronic structure for photocatalytic H2 evolution and constructs dynamic Ni clusters for chemical replacement reaction. This work provides the optimal S electronic structure for photocatalytic H2 evolution and constructs dynamic Ni clusters for displacement reaction, opening a dual pathway for efficient water reduction.",Journal of Colloid and Interface Science
Constructing three-dimensional N-doped carbon coating silicon/iron silicide nanoparticles cross-linked by carbon nanotubes as advanced anode materials for lithium-ion batteries,"© 2022 Elsevier Inc.Silicon (Si), have been considered as promising anode material for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), due to its high theoretical specific capacity of 4200 mAh g−1. However, the poor electrical conductivity and large volume change during lithiation/delithiation process, resulting in poor cycling stability, and seriously hindered the practical application in LIBs. Herein, a multiple Si/FexSiy@NC/CNTs composite is synthesized and investigated as advanced anode materials for LIBs via a simple one-step method. Such multiple Si/FexSiy@NC/CNTs composite has several merits including the FexSiy can not only accommodate the huge volume change of Si nanoparticles, but also enhance the conductivity upon discharge/charge process. Furthermore, the in-situ growth CNTs may help establish a long-range conductivity, and the Nitrogen-doped carbon (NC) layer can further improve the conductivity of Si, as well as inhibit the direct contract between electrolyte and Si during cycling process. Accordingly, the Si/FexSiy@NC/CNTs-1 exhibits excellent cycling stability (a high capacity of 994.4 mAh g−1 is maintained at 1.0 A g−1 after 600cycles) and outstanding rate capability (a suitable capacity of 441.7 mAh g−1 was obtained even at 5.0 A g−1). Moreover, the assembled full cell can achieve a capacity of 141.4 mAh g−1 after 65 cycles at 1.0C, exhibiting outstanding cycling stability. This work provides a prospective way for the commercial production of high-performance Si-based anode materials for LIBs.",Journal of Colloid and Interface Science

The excellent atomic utilization rate of single-atom catalysts (SACs) in combination with their high specific catalytic activity makes them extremely appealing for environmental remediation. As research in this field has progressed, many methods of preparing SACs have emerged. However, strategies for the construction of high stability SACs with reasonable generality are still urgently needed to be developed. As metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) possess a well-defined structure and a high specific surface area, they can be considered viable and promising materials for the manufacture of SACs. MOF-based SACs can combine the advantages of SACs and MOFs, showing conspicuous performance in environment-related catalysis. In this review, we summarize the reported synthesis methods and explain how MOF-based SACs can be constructed according to their structural characteristics. We briefly examine accessibility characterization techniques for SACs. Additionally, several representative reports are presented on the successful preparation of MOF-based SACs for environmental remediation (mainly advanced oxidation processes (AOPs)). Finally, we conclude by suggesting several future development directions for MOF-based SACs.",Coordination Chemistry Reviews
Strain engineering in alloy nanoparticles,"© 2022 The Author(s). Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.The deformation of interatomic distances with respect to those of the perfect crystal generates atomic-level strain. In nanoalloys, strain can arise because of finite size, morphology, domain structure and lattice mismatch between their atomic compounds. Strain can strongly affect the functional properties of nanoalloys, as it alters their electronic energy levels. Moreover, atomic-level strain generates atomic-level stress, which in turn results in distortions induced by strain. When the stress accumulated in a nanoalloy exceeds a certain level, the particle can relax that stress by undergoing structural transitions such as shape and/or chemical ordering transitions. Atomic-level strain is then a powerful tool to control and manipulate the structural and functional properties of nanoalloys. This requires a combined theoretical and experimental approach both to deeply understand the physical origin of strain, and to characterize it with a sub-angstrom resolution. Here, we present a theoretical analysis of the main sources of strain in nanoalloys, we analyse how atomic-level strain can be experimentally measured with transmission electron microscopy, we discuss its effect on the functional properties of nanoalloys, finally we describe how atomic-level stress arises from atomic-level strain, and how stress can induce structural transformations at the nanoscale.",Advances in Physics: X
Ultrafine CoFe nanoparticles supported on nitrogen-doped carbon sheets boost oxygen electrocatalysis for Zn-air batteries,"© 2022Efficient, durable and inexpensive electrocatalysts are urgently needed to mediate the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in rechargeable Zn-air batteries (ZABs). Herein, ultrafine CoFe alloyed nanoparticles (NPs) homogeneously decorated on N-doped carbon nanosheets (CoFe@NCS) are synthesized by annealing the precursor of NCS supported CoFe-based Prussian-blue-analogues. The optimal CoFe@NCS delivers prominent electrocatalytic behaviors for both the ORR (0.88 V of half-wave potential) and OER (340 mV of overpotential at 10 mA cm−2) in an alkaline electrolyte. The outstanding bifunctional electrocatalytic activities are ascribed to the synergistic interplay of structural and compositional advantages, including the hierarchically porous structure as well as the strong coupling of ultrafine CoFe species and NCS. Simultaneously, the assembled flow ZAB with CoFe@NCS as the air-cathode catalyst manifests a superior battery performance to the device catalyzed by the noble-metal benchmark (Pt/C + RuO2). This work may pave an avenue for developing efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts and promoting the practical application of ZABs.",Applied Surface Science
Emerging catalytic materials for practical lithium-sulfur batteries,"© 2022 Science Press and Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of SciencesHigh-energy lithium-sulfur batteries (LSBs) have experienced relentless development over the past decade with discernible improvements in electrochemical performance. However, a scrutinization of the cell operation conditions reveals a huge gap between the demands for practical batteries and those in the literature. Low sulfur loading, a high electrolyte/sulfur (E/S) ratio and excess anodes for lab-scale LSBs significantly offset their high-energy merit. To approach practical LSBs, high loading and lean electrolyte parameters are needed, which involve budding challenges of slow charge transfer, polysulfide precipitation and severe shuttle effects. To track these obstacles, the exploration of electrocatalysts to immobilize polysulfides and accelerate Li-S redox kinetics has been widely reported. Herein, this review aims to survey state-of-the-art catalytic materials for practical LSBs with emphasis on elucidating the correlation among catalyst design strategies, material structures and electrochemical performance. We also statistically evaluate the state-of-the-art catalyst-modified LSBs to identify the remaining discrepancy between the current advancements and the real-world requirements. In closing, we put forward our proposal for a catalytic material study to help realize practical LSBs.",Journal of Energy Chemistry
The current state of electrolytes and cathode materials development in the quest for aluminum-sulfur batteries,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Aluminum-ion batteries (AIBs) are an alternative to lithium-ion batteries due to their high volumetric capacity, low cost, and high safety. However, chloride aluminate ions destroy the structure of the host material during the electrochemical reaction, resulting in poor cycling life and low discharge capacity. Low-cost S can be used as AIBs cathode material with high energy density. This review focuses on non-aqueous aluminum-sulfur batteries (ASBs), with a detailed analysis of electrochemical performance data related to their electrolyte modification and modified cathode materials. Next, according to the literature statistics, the development of the structural design of cathode materials in non-aqueous ASBs is reviewed and the related electrochemical reaction mechanism is analyzed in detail. In addition, the problems and expected solutions in the study of non-aqueous ASBs are discussed, and future research directions are proposed.",Coordination Chemistry Reviews
Science and engineering for non-noble-metal-based electrocatalysts to boost their ORR performance: A critical review,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Metal-air batteries (MABs) and fuel cells (FCs) critically rely on electrocatalytic O2 activation, and O2 reduction reaction (ORR), with noble metal-free materials. However, the inception of their synergist reactivity is still unclear due to several electronic and structural limitations. Therefore, the correlation between their science and engineering and their experimental as well as theoretical activity descriptors can pave the way for the development of novel cheap, and efficient catalysts. Moreover, with this framework, several volcanic correlations were established, indicating that catalyst activity increases linearly with increasing binding energy of ORR intermediates up to a certain point, but after that, the activity decreases as binding energy increases. The motivation of this review is to highlight (i) recent designs and developments on non-noble-metal-containing electrocatalysts for ORR, (ii) correlations between science and engineering and existing activity descriptors to improve the electrocatalyst's ORR performance, and (iii) prospects and challenges with non-noble-metal-based electrocatalysts. The “science and engineering” of the electrode materials discussed in this review will aid researchers in selecting and designing ORR electrocatalysts for energy conversion processes.",Coordination Chemistry Reviews
Hierarchically porous Co@N-doped carbon fiber assembled by MOF-derived hollow polyhedrons enables effective electronic/mass transport: An advanced 1D oxygen reduction catalyst for Zn-air battery,"© 2022 Science Press and Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of SciencesDeveloping advanced oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) electrocatalysts with rapid mass/electron transport as well as conducting relevant kinetics investigations is essential for energy technologies, but both still face ongoing challenges. Herein, a facile approach was reported for achieving the highly dispersed Co nanoparticles anchored hierarchically porous N-doped carbon fibers (Co@N-HPCFs), which were assembled by core-shell MOFs-derived hollow polyhedrons. Notably, the unique one-dimensional (1D) carbon fibers with hierarchical porosity can effectively improve the exposure of active sites and facilitate the electron transfer and mass transfer, resulting in the enhanced reaction kinetics. As a result, the ORR performance of the optimal Co@N-HPCF catalysts remarkably outperforms that of commercial Pt/C in alkaline solution, reaching a limited diffusion current density (J) of 5.85 mA cm−2 and a half-wave potential (E1/2) of 0.831 V. Particularly, the prepared Co@N-HPCF catalysts can be used as an excellent air-cathode for liquid/solid-state Zn-air batteries, exhibiting great potentiality in portable/wearable energy devices. Furthermore, the reaction kinetic during ORR process is deeply explored by finite element simulation, so as to intuitively grasp the kinetic control region, diffusion control region, and mixing control region of the ORR process, and accurately obtain the relevant kinetic parameters. This work offers an effective strategy and a reliable theoretical basis for the engineering of first-class ORR electrocatalysts with fast electronic/mass transport.",Journal of Energy Chemistry
Oxygen vacancies in open-hollow microcapsule enable accelerated kinetics for stable Li-S battery,"© 2022The fast development of lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries is catching more attention to improve cycling stability and kinetics. Herein, a hierarchical porous Ni/NiO/C microsphere (NIONC) with openings assembled by ultrathin nanosheets is introduced to solve the poor conductivity, shuttle effect, and slow electrochemical kinetics of Li-S batteries. The structure of NIONC open-hollow microcapsules combines several advantageous properties for the improvement of electrochemical performances. Primarily, a well-developed hollow structure and openings can perform as containers and doors for sulfur immobilization. Therefore, the confinement effect to sulfur species is obtained by this hollow sphere. Secondly, the nanosheets with oxygen vacancies and Ni active sites provide abundant active sites for the chemical absorption of polysulfides. Based on the open structure and oxygen vacancies of Ni/NiO, both the physical absorption and chemical immobilization of sulfur are realized, with high stability and fast kinetics. The S-injected NIONC (NIONC/S) cathode exhibits outstanding rate performance at 5 A g-1 with a high capability of 794 mAh g-1 and excellent long-cycle performance of 653 mAh g-1 after 300 cycles at 1 A g-1. We proposed a simple and controllable route to fabricate sulfur hosts by structure and composition adjustment, which will inspire the commercial application of Li-S batteries.",Journal of Colloid and Interface Science
Mechanism of LaFeO3 perovskite and gradient strain nanocrystalline improving carbon atom diffusion and tribological properties of carburizing steel,© 2022 Elsevier LtdA composite layer of gradient nanocrystals and LaFeO3 perovskite oxide was prepared. The influence of the composite layer on the diffusion of carbon atoms and the change of wear mechanism was studied. The experimental data and related mechanisms show that the formation mechanism of gradient nanocrystalline layer mainly involves dislocation slip and strain gradient evolution at grain boundaries. The oxygen vacancies provided by nano oxides improve the surface activity of the samples and promote the diffusion of carbon to deep layers. The existence of composite layer changes the wear mode of different depths. The oxide film formed on the surface promoted by rare earth provides the effect of anti-wear and lubrication. Oxygen vacancies improves the anti-spalling ability of oxide film.,Tribology International
Three-dimensional ordered macroporous design of heterogeneous nickel-iron phosphide as bifunctional electrocatalyst for enhanced overall water splitting,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Developing high-performance oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) bifunctional electrocatalysts is essential for overall water splitting. Herein, heterogeneous engineering-induced strategy was demonstrated by the synthesis of bimetallic Ni2P/FeP/Fe2P heterostructure with three-dimensional ordered macroporous structure (3DOM-Ni2P/FexP) as bifunctional catalyst. The heterogeneous interfaces formed by the three distinct phases can adjust the electron distribution and create abundant active sites to improve the catalytic performance. The 3DOM structure provides large specific surface area and good mass transfer for electrocatalytic reaction occurring at the solid-gas-electrolyte multiphase interfaces. Accordingly, the 3DOM-Ni2P/FexP showed remarkable OER and HER electrocatalytic activity in 1 M KOH electrolyte. Moreover, it demonstrates that the 3DOM-Ni2P/FexP turns out oxidation and transformation during the OER process. Computational results reveal the synergy of the converted Fe2O3/NiOOH, promoting the OER reaction energetics. In addition, an alkaline electrolyzer with the 3DOM-Ni2P/FexP as both the cathode and anode achieves excellent overall water splitting performance, with only 1.54 V voltage to obtain the current density of 10 mA cm−2. This present study gives a novel concept of heterogeneous engineering-induced bimetallic phosphide with macroporous structure design towards the high-performing OER and HER bifunctional electrocatalysts evolvement.",Applied Surface Science
Coordination polymer-derived non-precious metal catalyst for propane dehydrogenation: Highly dispersed zinc anchored on N-doped carbon,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Highly dispersed non-precious metal catalysts supported on carbon have been intensively explored in the field of heterogeneous catalysis and material science owing to its low price, special electronic and geometric structure. However, their application and improvement of catalytic efficiency in alkane dehydrogenation were chronically limited due to spontaneous aggregation of metal atoms under the harsh conditions, low loading content and the complex preparation process. A new type of lamellar coordination polymer and a series of well-dispersed zinc-based catalyst anchored on N-doped carbon nanosheets were prepared via a facile combination of self-assembly and controlled pyrolysis. These carbonized composites showed superior initial activity (the propane conversion at 34% and the olefin selectivity at 80%) and acceptable catalytic stability (the deactivation rate of 0.082 h−1) in propane DDH reactions (600 °C, 2.4 kPa C3H8, He balance). The structure analysis results indicated the zinc loading in the optimized sample can be up to 19 wt%, which was also effectively retained after reactions. The systematic investigation on structure–function relations revealed that the catalytic activity originated from highly dispersed Zn, and the improvement of its performance could be ascribed to the mutual promotion between zinc loading and specific surface area. This work provided new guidelines to enable further development of the carbon-supported zinc-based catalyst in alkane dehydrogenation reactions and promoted the rational design of highly dispersed metal materials.",Applied Surface Science
Spatial decoupling of dehydrogenation and CO oxidation by Ni-Co-Ti hierarchical trimetallic catalyst for electrocatalytic oxidation of methanol,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Methanol electro-oxidation reaction (MOR) is the kernel of methanol fuel cell. When the multi-step microscopic transformations process of MOR couples and occurs on the same active site, undoubtedly it reduces the probability of reaction and increases the steric hindrance, resulting in slow reaction kinetics and degradation of catalytic performance. In order to decouple the dehydrogenation and CO oxidation in MOR, herein we synthesized the hierarchical catalyst (NiCo/N-TiO2 @NaOH) with bifunctional spatial distribution, which displayed 73 mA cm−2 at the potential of 1.5 V (vs. RHE) and only 20 % degradation of performance after continuously electrolysis over 40,000 s. Based on analysis of mass transfer and electron transport in hierarchical structure, combining with in-situ mass spectrometry and theory calculation, the high MOR performance of NiCo/N-TiO2 can be ascribed to the spatial decoupling the MOR reactions including dehydrogenation under synergic effect of Ni/Co and CO oxidation on N-TiO2 film.",Applied Catalysis B: Environmental
Atomic scale synergistic interactions lead to breakthrough catalysts for electrocatalytic water splitting,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.A breakthrough catalyst for electrocatalytic water splitting, precious-metal-free equi-molar high entropy alloy H-FeCoNiCuMo, is developed through exploring and maximizing strong synergistic interactions between atomically well-mixed constituents of H-FeCoNiCuMo over atomic scales. For overall electrolytic water splitting under severe industrial operation conditions, the H-FeCoNiCuMo//H-FeCoNiCuMo couple requires only an ultralow cell voltage of 1.627 V to deliver an ultrahigh current density of 1500 mA cm−2, and remains stable after a 100-hr continuous operation, largely outperforming a precious metal-based benchmark couple, Pt/C//IrO2, 2.038 V with 55% decay in 24 hr. A new catalytic phenomenon is discovered, two different catalytic mechanisms functioning simultaneously on different constituents of H-FeCoNiCuMo, the Volmer-Heyrovsky route on Co and Cu and Volmer-Tafel route on Ni and Mo, from which a new kinetic model is formulated to predict a new theoretical lower limit of Tafel slope of 15 mV dec−1 for hydrogen evolution reactions.",Applied Catalysis B: Environmental
"MXene terminating groups [dbnd]O, –F or –OH, –F or [dbnd]O, –OH, –F, or [dbnd]O, –OH, –Cl?","© 2022 Science Press and Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of SciencesMXenes are a novel family of two-dimensional (2D) materials that are fast gaining popularity due to their versatile characteristics. The surfaces of these materials are often functionalized by negatively charged terminal groups, such as [dbnd]O, OH, and F during their synthesis, and it has been hypothesized that regulating the surface terminators enables to control the material characteristics. However, there is still a large gap between computational and experimental investigations regarding comprehending the surface functional groups. Surfaces with mixed terminations are consistently synthesized in experiments, although pure terminated surfaces are predicted by computational research. Here we summarized the nature of chemical bonding in transition metal carbide materials (MXenes) by 1H and 19F nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), Raman, X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES), extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS), ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)/scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), and thermogravimetric analysis-mass spectrometry (TGA-MS) characterizations. Previous literature reveals that [dbnd]O, –OH, –F, and –Cl are typical MXene surface terminators. However, recent comparative investigations on the valence band intensity distribution in MXenes reveal that the –OH cannot be considered an intrinsic termination species in MXenes. The surface terminals ([dbnd]O, –OH, –F, and –Cl) of several MXenes, particularly V2CTx and Ti3C2Tx, will be identified and quantified here. We have also discussed different etching approaches for the synthesis of MXene, the dependence of MXene conductivity on MXene terminating groups, and the emission of various gaseous products that evolved during its chemical transformations. This paper provides significance, especially in the field of energy conversion and storage materials, where the intercalation process is crucial.",Journal of Energy Chemistry
Pt/C as a bifunctional ORR/iodide oxidation reaction (IOR) catalyst for Zn-air batteries with unprecedentedly high energy efficiency of 76.5%,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Rechargeable Zn-air batteries (ZABs) are promising for energy storage and conversion. However, the low energy efficiency caused by the high charging voltage greatly hinders their commercialization. Herein, potassium iodide (KI) is introduced to ZABs to change the oxidation pathway from the sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER) to I- oxidation reaction (IOR) with faster kinetics and lower oxidation potential. Unexpectedly, the commercial carbon-based catalyst Pt/C with poor OER activity exhibits remarkable IOR activity. Benefitting from its high oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity, the fabricated ZABs deliver a low charging voltage of 1.68 V, high energy efficiency of 76.5%, and long cycle life of over 80 h at 5 mA cm−2. Density functional theory (DFT) calculation is conducted to reveal the IOR catalytic mechanism of the Pt/C catalyst. This work will reverse the traditional mindset on catalyst selection from ORR/OER to ORR/IOR and boost the commercialization of rechargeable ZABs.",Applied Catalysis B: Environmental
Engineering the surface chemical microenvironment over CuO nanowire arrays by polyaniline modification for efficient ammonia electrosynthesis from nitrate,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Electrochemical nitrate reduction into ammonia offers an attractive alternative to value-added ammonia (NH3) production under benign conditions. The critical to achieve satisfactory NH3 production rate from nitrate electroreduction that can compare with industrial Haber–Bosch route is the development of highly efficient electrocatalysts. In this work, we descript a post-modification strategy for synthesizing polyaniline (PANI)-modified CuO nanowire arrays (CuO@PANI) for selective electrocatalytic nitrate-to-ammonia transformation. Surface modification of CuO with PANI can not only well-retain the nanowire array structure and large specific surface area, but also modulate the surface chemical microenvironment of catalyst, which promotes nitrate enrichment and hydrogenated species accumulation, and thus facilitates selective nitrate-to-ammonia transformation. As a result, the CuO@PANI exhibits high Faradaic efficiency (93.88%) and excellent NH3 selectivity (91.38%) for NH3 electrosynthesis from nitrate. The strategy is worthy for designing high-efficiency electrocatalysts by surface modification with organic molecular or polymers for selective nitrate reduction into ammonia.",Applied Catalysis B: Environmental
Tuning oxygen vacancy in SnO2 inhibits Pt migration and agglomeration towards high-performing fuel cells,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.The serious durability concerns of carbon supported Pt electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) have strictly limited the commercialization of fuel cells. Herein, cable-like carbon nanotubes (CNTs)@SnO2 core@shell supports with regulable electronic metal-support interaction (EMSI) are designed for Pt nanoparticles (NPs) as ORR catalysts. Impressively, the best-performing Pt-CNT@SnO2 catalyst with optimized d-band center achieves an excellent activity (mass activity (MA) of 0.68 A mgPt−1 at 0.9 ViR-free and peak power density of 1618 mW cm−2) and record-high durability in H2-O2 fuel cells (9.2 % MA and 8 % power density loss after 5k cycles under 1.0–1.5 V) among the reported Pt-based catalysts, which is also superior to the U.S. DOE 2025 targets. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the strong metal-support bonding interaction (SMSBI) endows much larger adhesion energy and migration barrier towards Pt atoms compared to carbon supports, leading to the extraordinarily high stability in fuel cells.",Applied Catalysis B: Environmental
Synthesis of very small molybdenum disulfide nanoflowers for hydrogen evolution reaction,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Among various transition metal dichalcogenides, molybdenum disulfides such as molybdenum disulfide nanoflowers (MoS2 NFs) can effectively catalyze a hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) because of the abundance, ease of processing, and high catalytic activity of MoS2. The main disadvantage of using MoS2 NFs for HER on the industrial scale is their low density and number of active sites. Herein, we propose for the first time a facile, inexpensive, and scalable route for fabricating extremely small MoS2 NFs (SNFs). The size of the synthesized MoS2 SNFs (50–90 nm) is much lower than that of conventional MoS2 NFs (900–1500 nm), which significantly increases the number of catalytically active sites. In addition, the in situ doping of N atoms considerably enhances the catalytic activity of the prepared MoS2 SNFs. MoS2 SNFs exhibit superior electrocatalytic activity toward HER with a low Tafel slope 49 mV·dec−1, an overpotential of 270 mV at a current density of 50 mA·cm−2, a large surface area of 98 m2·g−1, and very high stability in an acidic environment. The obtained results indicate that MoS2 SNFs can be potentially used for energy storage and electrochemical applications.",Applied Surface Science
Feasibility of nanomaterial tungsten carbide as lead-free nanomaterial-based radiation shielding,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdRadiation shielding material is essential to protect humans and the environment from direct exposure to ionizing radiation. The ionizing radiation is best absorbed by high-density materials and heavy atoms like lead. The drawback of lead is that it is toxic, heavy, non-transparent, and bulky, which are often undesirable features for most applications. As a result, while the development of nanomaterials as radiation shielding materials is a promising field of study, a complete evaluation of the application of tungsten carbide nanofilm as a lead-free shielding material is still lacking in the literature. Tungsten carbide is an attractive material because it can be formed into a film using various fabrication processes suitable for a wide range of substrates. Moreover, tungsten carbide has a high atomic number, greater density, and better shielding characteristics compared to lead. Therefore, the purpose of this review was to provide recent advancements in the physical properties of tungsten carbide, the application of tungsten carbide nanofilm as radiation shielding material, and an overview of thin film deposition and deposition techniques that include the morphological structure of tungsten carbide nanofilm. The key challenges and future direction are also discussed.",Radiation Physics and Chemistry
Modulating electronic structure of lattice O-modified orange polymeric carbon nitrogen to promote photocatalytic CO2 conversion,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Adsorption and activation of CO2, and high carriers transform efficiency are of great significance for improving the CO2 photoreduction performance. However, electronic structure regulation plays an important role in the dynamical behavior of carriers. In this study, O atoms were successfully introduced into polymeric carbon nitrogen to synthesize an orange O-modified polymeric carbon nitrogen and achieve the rearrangement of electron density distribution, which promotes the adsorption and activation of CO2 and efficient separation and migration of carriers. DFT calculation demonstrates that the O atoms perform as the dominant active sites and reduce the free energy of determining step. Moreover, the introduction of O atoms broadens the light absorption range by changing the electronic layer structure of polymeric carbon nitrogen. Therefore, the fabricated O-modified polymeric carbon nitrogen exhibits significant performance. Under visible light irradiation, the CO generation efficiency achieved a 10-fold boost. We synthesize theory and experiment to highlight the important role of modulating electronic structure in designing photocatalysts.",Applied Catalysis B: Environmental
"Improved oxygen evolution reaction performance in Co0.4Mn0.6O2 nanosheets through Triple-doping (Cu, P, N) strategy and its application to Zn-air battery","© 2022In this work, we successfully synthesized bimetallic transition oxides into two-dimensional nanosheets, which expose all the catalytic sites on the surface. Then, Cu, N, and P elements were rationally doped inside the as prepared Co0.4Mn0.6O2 nanosheets to activate the Co/Mn catalytic sites. It is found that the resulting N/P-Cu0.1Co0.3Mn0.6O2/CNTs composites show an overpotential η10 of 290 mV for OER, much lower than the value measured using the original Co0.4Mn0.6O2/CNTs (463 mV). Meanwhile, N/P-Cu0.1Co0.3Mn0.6O2/CNTs also show decent performance with a half potential (E1/2) of 0.82 V vs RHE for ORR, i.e., a 702 mV voltage difference for OER and ORR, much lower than other transition metal oxide catalysts. By using N/P-Cu0.1Co0.3Mn0.6O2/CNTs as a cathodic catalyst for ZAB, we measured superior performance, with a peak power density of 108.1 mW cm−2 and stable operation for over 200 h at 10 mA cm−2, better than IrO2-Pt/C-based ZAB.",Applied Catalysis B: Environmental
Efficient CO2 reduction to reveal the piezocatalytic mechanism: From displacement current to active sites,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Piezocatalysis has attracted the increasing interest of researchers as a novel catalytic method. To date, there are two popular mechanisms regarding the piezocatalysis, i.e., the piezoelectric effect and the energy band theory. However, both mechanisms cannot fully explain the piezocatalytic process: the electrons generated by the piezoelectric effect will not spontaneously participate in the piezocatalysis, while not all piezoelectric materials have an appropriate energy band structure. In this work, displacement current and the principle of piezoelectric nanogenerator are introduced to fully comprehend the piezocatalytic mechanism for the first time. As a proof-of-concept catalytic system, we synthesize Co-N-C@BaTiO3 piezocatalyst for the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) under ultrasonic vibration. A promising piezocatalytic CO2 reduction rate of 261.8 mol g−1h−1 is achieved with a high CO selectivity up to 93.8% under 50 kHz ultrasonic vibration. The CO yields of this catalytic system outperform most of the reported photocatalytic CO2RR and piezocatalytic CO2RR. Moreover, a comprehensive piezocatalytic mechanism from displacement current to active sites is proposed and supported by combining Co-N-C@BaTiO3 piezoelectric nanogenerator, COMSOL simulation and energy band structure analysis. Under the ultrasonic vibration, the electrons generated by the piezoelectric effect are driven by the time-varying electrostatic potential formed by the displacement current. The suitable band structure of piezoelectric provider that satisfies the potential of reaction promotes electrons to participate in CO2RR on active sites. Overall, our work provides an insightful understanding of piezocatalysis and paves a new path for its development.",Applied Catalysis B: Environmental
Enhancing electrochemical nitrogen fixation by mimicking π back-donation on laser-tuned Lewis acid sites in noble-metal-molybdenum carbide,"© 2022Conventional electrocatalysts underperform with reaction kinetics, nitrogen dissociation, and activated hydrogen recombination, demanding effective strategies for improving electrochemical nitrogen fixation. The challenge lies in the rational design of electron back-donating centers for nitrogen activation and hydrogen migration path optimization. This study proposes an effective laser-tuning strategy to construct noble-metal Lewis acid sites on molybdenum carbide (M-Mo2C, M = Ru, Rh, Pd, Ir), yielding a more active material system by mimicking π back-donation behavior. Laser-tuned Lewis acid sites can effectively break N≡N bonds, lower thermodynamic energy barrier of the rate-determining hydrogenation step (*NN → *N-NH), and optimize hydrogen migration pathway. The Rh-Mo2C shows superior NRR activity with NH3 yield of ∼26.3 µg h−1 cm−2cat. and Faradaic efficiency of ∼15.4%, which are 5.1- and 3.6-fold higher than those of Mo2C, respectively. This work demonstrates a unique and universal strategy for designing high-performance electrocatalysts by accurately manipulating electronic structure of active sites.",Applied Catalysis B: Environmental
Impacts of ruthenium valence state on the electrocatalytic activity of ruthenium ion-complexed graphitic carbon nitride/reduced graphene oxide nanosheets towards hydrogen evolution reaction,"© 2022 Elsevier Inc.Design and engineering of effective electrode catalysts represents a critical first step for hydrogen production by electrochemical water splitting. Nanocomposites based on ruthenium atomically dispersed within a carbon scaffold have emerged as viable candidates. In the present study, ruthenium metal centers are atomically embedded within graphitic carbon nitride/reduced graphene oxide nanosheets by thermal refluxing. Subsequent chemical reduction/oxidation leads to ready manipulation of the ruthenium valence state, as evidenced in microscopic and spectroscopic measurements, and hence enhancement/diminishment of the electrocatalytic activity towards hydrogen evolution reaction in both acidic and alkaline media. This is largely ascribed to the increased/reduced contribution of the Ru valence electrons to the density of state near the Fermi level which dictates the binding and reduction of hydrogen. Results from this study highlight the significance of the valence state of metal centers in the manipulation and optimization of the catalytic performance of single atom catalysts.",Journal of Colloid and Interface Science
Ultrafine oxygenophilic nanoalloys induced by multifunctional interstitial boron for methanol oxidation reaction,"© 2022 Elsevier Inc.Interface construction is one of the most feasible approaches to optimize the physical and chemical properties of noble metal-based catalysts and consequently improve their catalytic performance. Herein, the design of effective reaction interfaces by bimetallic, trimetallic or polymetallic alloying has been extensively explored. In this research, metalloid boron (B) was alloyed within palladium-iridium (Pd-Ir) nanoalloy supported on nitrogen-doped graphene (NG) to promote the methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) in alkaline media. Being benefited from this, the optimum Pd7IrBx/NG catalyst exhibited enhanced EOR activity mass activity (1141.7 mA mg−1) and long-term stability (58.2 % current density retention rate after 500 cycles of cyclic voltammetry). The mechanism was further studied by electrochemical experiments and characterization, which highlighted that the multifunctional effect of electronic effect and strain effect and kinetic optimization induced by boron doping played a very positive role on MOR.",Journal of Colloid and Interface Science
Single cobalt atom anchored on carbon nitride with cobalt nitrogen/oxygen active sites for efficient Fenton-like catalysis,"© 2022As one of the tactics to produce reactive oxygen radicals, the Fenton-like process has been widely developed to solve the increasingly severe problem of environmental pollution. However, establishing advanced mediators with sufficient stability and activity for practical application is still a long-term objective. Herein, we proposed a facile strategy through polymeric carbon nitride (pCN) in-situ growth single cobalt atom for efficient degradation of antibiotics by peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation. X-ray absorption spectroscopy and high-angle annular dark field-scanning transmission electron microscopy prove the single cobalt atoms are successfully anchored on pCN. Moreover, extended X-ray absorption fine structure analysis shows that the embedded cobalt atoms are constructed by covalently forming the Co-N bond and Co-O bond, which endow the single-atom cobalt catalyst with high stability. Experiment results indicate that the prepared single-atom cobalt catalyst can be used for efficient PMS activation catalytic degradation of tetracycline with a high degradation rate of 98.7 % in 60 min. And the CoN/O sites with single cobalt atoms serve as the active site for generating active radical species (singlet oxygen) from PMS activation. This work may expand the strategy for constructing single-atom catalysts and extend its application for the advanced oxidation process.",Journal of Colloid and Interface Science
Construction of seaurchin-like structured Ag2Se-Ag2S-CoCH/NF electrocatalyst with high catalytic activity and corrosion resistance for seawater electrolysis,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.It is extremely necessary and challenging to rationally design highly active, stable and anti-corrosion electrocatalysts for the hydrogen production by seawater electrolysis. Herein, we developed a new and effective strategy of monometallic cation release combined with hydrothermal reaction to successfully construct an Ag2Se-Ag2S-CoCH/NF seaurchin-like heterostructure on nickel foam substrate. The active species exposure, corrosion resistance, H2O dissociation ability and free energy of adsorbed hydrogen in Ag2Se-Ag2S active carrier were concurrently regulated to strikingly promote the HER/OER in alkaline water and seawater electrolysis. Concretely, the incorporation of CoCH into the Ag2Se-Ag2S binary superionic conductor, as reflected by the corresponding characterizations and theoretical calculations (DFT), not only enriches the vacancy defect structure for the effective exposure of active sites, but also strongly emerges the electronic structure effect between Ag2Se-Ag2S and CoCH, bringing about the reduction of hydrogen adsorption free energy. Besides, such unique seaurchin-like heterostructure has a large electrochemically active area and uninterrupted proton-electron transmission function as well as the interlayer anion exchangeability of CoCH nanoneedles to exhibit prominently water dissociation ability and good resistance to chlorine corrosion. Consequently, Ag2Se-Ag2S-CoCH/NF achieves a fairly low HER overpotential of 35 mV at 10 mA cm−2 and an OER overpotential of 440 mV at 100 mA cm−2 in alkaline water and seawater, which is one of the most effective HER electrocatalysts reported so far. Furthermore, Ag2Se-Ag2S-CoCH/NF can be acted as a bifunctional catalyst to display a decent overall seawater splitting performance in alkaline simulated seawater. It also demonstrates outstanding and stable HER activity along with favorable corrosion resistance in natural seawater. This work is important for the rationally constructing of efficient and anti-corrosion electrocatalysts applied in seawater electrolysis.",Applied Surface Science
Hematite decorated with nanodot-like cobalt (oxy)hydroxides for boosted photoelectrochemical water oxidation,"© 2022 Elsevier Inc.Photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting has been considered as an alternative process to produce green hydrogen. However, the energy conversion efficiency of PEC systems was still limited by the inefficient photoanode. Cocatalysts decoration is regarded as an efficient strategy for improving PEC performance of photoanode. In this work, nanodot-like cobalt (oxy)hydroxides was rationally decorated on hematite to fabricate CoOOH/Fe2O3 photoanode. The resulted CoOOH/Fe2O3 exhibits a high photocurrent density of 1.92 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE, which is 2.6 times than that of bare Fe2O3. In addition, the onset potential displays a cathodic shift of ca. 110 mV, indicating that CoOOH can efficiently accelerate water oxidation kinetics over Fe2O3. The comprehensive PEC and electrochemical characterizations reveal that CoOOH could not only provide abundant accessible Co active sites for water oxidation, but also could passivate the surface states of Fe2O3, thus increase the carrier density and decrease the interfacial resistance. As a result, the PEC water oxidation performance over Fe2O3 was significantly boosted. This work supports that the roles of CoOOH cocatalyst is generic and such CoOOH could be used for other semiconductor-based photoanodes for outstanding PEC water splitting performance.",Journal of Colloid and Interface Science

Theoretical computations identify B-dopants as the pivotal active sites to enhance NO3– activation and optimize the free energies of reaction intermediates, leading to the expedited NO3RR activity. Meanwhile, the undesired hydrogen evolution can be well suppressed on B-MoS2 to render a high NO3RR selectivity.",Journal of Colloid and Interface Science
Multi-function hollow nanorod as an efficient sulfur host accelerates sulfur redox reactions for high-performance Li-S batteries,"© 2022 Elsevier Inc.The “shuttle effect” of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) leads to loss of active materials and the deterioration of cycle stability, which seriously restricts the practical progress of lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries. The diffusion of soluble discharge intermediate is the root cause of the above problems. Herein, we synthesized a porous organic framework material (HUT-8) based on triazine network, the polar groups above the hollow structure can not only adsorb LiPSs through electron donating effect, but also anchored cobalt (II) ions provide a large number of binding sites for the in-situ growth of CoS2. This ensured maximized exposure of catalytic centre and improve their interactions with sulfur redox species under the confinement of mesopores, which can catalytically accelerate capture/diffusion of LiPSs and precipitation/decomposition of Li2S. Based on the synergistic effect of the composite materials, the CoS2-HUT-8/S cathode maintained a capacity of 583 mAh g−1 after 500 cycles at 1 C, and a minimum capacity fading rate of 0.046% per cycle. A freestanding CoS2-HUT-8/S cathode with sulfur loading of 5.2 mg cm−2 delivered a high areal capacity of 4.01 mAh cm−2 under a lean electrolyte, which would provide great potential for the practical progress of Li-S batteries.",Journal of Colloid and Interface Science
Fine-tune d-band center of cobalt vanadium oxide nanosheets by N-doping as a robust overall water splitting electrocatalyst,"© 2022 Elsevier Inc.Developing high-activity, long-durability, and noble metal-free oxygen evolution (OER) and hydrogen evolution (HER) cocatalysts are the bottlenecks for efficient overall water splitting (OWS). Here, novel cobalt vanadium oxides doped by nitrogen were synthesized by nitriding Co2V2O7@NF precursor at 300–450 °C for OER and HER reactions. N-Co2V2O7@NF (350 °C) and N-Co2VO4/VO2@NF (400 °C) show remarkable OER and HER performance with overpotentials of 310 mV and 224 mV at high current density (100 mA cm−2). Besides, they also revealed long-term solid stability even after 170 h and 700 h of continuous performance. Furthermore, the N-Co2V2O7@NF(+)||N-Co2VO4/VO2@NF(–) OWS device possesses a cell voltage of 1.93 V at 500 mA cm−2 better than RuO2@NF(+)||Pt/C@NF(–) (2.02 V) and can operate for 60 h with almost no degradation. This extraordinary performance can be attributed to the nanosheet structure, which can maximize the exposure of active sites and accelerate the mass transfer. Moreover, density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggest that N-doping can fine-tune the d-band center and band gap to facilitate intermediate adsorption and electron motion. The method presented here can be applied in other novel N-doped electrocatalysts for the energy field.",Journal of Colloid and Interface Science

In the study, without using any template or surfactant, we successfully designed novel cross-linked manganese borate (Mn3(BO3)2) and iron carbide (Fe3C) embedded into boron (B) and nitrogen (N) co-doped three-dimensional (3D) hierarchically meso/macroporous carbon nanowires (denoted as FexMny@BN-PCFs). Electrochemical test results showed that the HER and OER catalytic activities of Fe1Mn1@BN-PCFs were close to those of 20 wt% Pt/C and RuO2. For full water splitting, (-) Fe1Mn1@BN-PCFs||Fe1Mn1@BN-PCF (+) cell achieved a current density of 10 mA cm−2 at a cell voltage of 1.622 V, which was 14.2 mV larger than that of (-) 20 wt% Pt/C||RuO2 (+) benchmark. The synergistic effect of 3D hierarchically meso/macroporous architectures, excellent charge transport capacity, and abundant active centers (cross-linked Mn3(BO3)2/Fe3C@BNC, BC3, pyridinic-N, M–N–C, and graphitic-N) enhanced the water splitting catalytic activity of Fe1Mn1@BN-PCFs. The (-) Fe1Mn1@BN-PCFs||Fe1Mn1@BN-PCF (+) cell exhibited excellent stability owing to the superior structural and chemical stabilities of 3D hierarchically porous Fe1Mn1@BN-PCFs.",Journal of Colloid and Interface Science

This study successfully prepared a polyhedron nanostructured Pd and MoO2-embedded polyaniline-functionalized graphitized carbon nitride (PANI-g-C3N4) surface using a chemical reduction method. The Pd–Mo/PANI-g-C3N4 achieved an ORR activity of 0.27 mA µg−1 and 1.14 mA cm−2 at 0.85 V, which were 4.5 times higher than those of commercial 20% Pt/C catalyst (0.06 mA µg−1 and 0.14 mA cm−2). In addition, the Pd–Mo/PANI-g-C3N4 retained ∼ 77.5% of its initial mass activity after 10,000 cycles, with only 30 mV half-wave potential reduction. Further, the engineered potential active sites in the catalyst material verified the significant improvement in the ORR activity of the catalyst with increased life-time, and theoretical calculations revealed that the synergistic effect of the catalytic components enhanced the ORR kinetics of the active sites.",Journal of Colloid and Interface Science
Boron-doping on the surface mediated low-valence Co centers in cobalt phosphide for improved electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Rationally engineering the surface structure of transition metal phosphides (TMPs) could regulate valence state of metal centers (Mδ+) with optimized binding strength of H2O and H* and relative Gibbs free energy (ΔGH*) in alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). However, the precise location of such metal centers is still challenging due to the limited synthetic methodology. Herein we report the surface-layer-confined doping of boron on cobalt phosphide nanowire arrays (B-CoP) via a controllable surface redox reaction. Nanowire CoP decorated with B-doped surface layer structure has proved to be an outstanding HER electrocatalyst, with an overpotential of 112 mV at 100 mA cm−2. X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis, and theoretical results demonstrate that B-doping induced electron redistribution of Co with electron-rich features.

New insight into photocatalytic CO2 conversion with nearly 100% CO selectivity by CuO-Pd/HxMoO3−y hybrids,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Photocatalytic CO2 reduction holds promise for solving climate change. However, low conversion efficiency and low product selectivity limit current systems. Here, we report a strategy involving CuO-Pd deposited on HxMoO3−y with abundant oxygen vacancies (OVs) that drives CO2 photocatalytic reduction toward CO with nearly 100% selectivity and apparent quantum efficiency of 3.0% at 650 nm in H2O vapor at 100 °C. Detailed characterizations demonstrate that high performance mainly stems from the synergistic effect of the paired Cu-Pd sites in CuO-Pd and OVs in HxMoO3−y, where OVs serve as CO2 adsorption sites and induce the migration of localized electrons across the Schottky barrier to Cu-Pd sites, and then Cu-Pd sites promote CO2 reduction to CO. Theoretical calculation shows the strong hybridizations of Cu 3d - and Pd 3d - O 2p orbitals accelerate electrons transfer from CuO-Pd to CO2, effectively optimizing the rate-limiting step (CO2 * → COOH*).",Applied Catalysis B: Environmental

2D RhTe Monolayer: A highly efficient electrocatalyst for oxygen reduction reaction,"© 2022 Elsevier Inc.Oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) electrocatalysts with excellent activity and high selectivity toward the efficient four-electron (4e) pathway are very important for the wide application of fuel cells and are worth searching vigorously. In this study, r-RhTe monolayer is identified as a good ORR electrocatalyst from three 2D RhTe configurations with low Rh-loading (i.e., r-RhTe, o-RhTe and h-RhTe) on the basis of the first-principles calculations. For the most energetically stable r-RhTe, two adjacent positively charged Te atoms on the material surface can provide an active site for oxygen dissociation. Coupled with its high stability and intrinsic conductivity, 2D r-RhTe monolayer is confirmed to possess good catalytic activity and high reaction selectivity toward ORR. Moreover, under the ligand effect caused by the substitution of Cr, Mn and Fe, the ORR catalytic activity of r-RhTe monolayer could be effectively enhanced, where very small over-potential was achieved, and even comparable to or lower than the state-of-the-art Pt (1 1 1).

Enhanced hardness and conductivity motivated by Ni and Co doping in β-MoB2,"© 2022Searching for high hardness conductors in transition metal borides (TMBs) is important, which can be used in extreme environment. But hardness and conductivity are contradictory due to high hardness is caused by local electrons to form covalent bonds and better conductivity arises from free electrons of metal bonds. Simultaneously obtaining high hardness and better conductivity is still a challenge. In this work, a new strategy is suggested by doping soft transition metals (Ni/Co) into TMBs (β-MoB2 (R3¯m)). This strategy avoids strengthening the ionic or covalent bonds to enhance hardness, but utilizing low-doping-content-strengthen (LDCS) mechanism to enhance hardness. The LDCS is found in the doping content of 3% in Co0.03Mo0.97B2 and Ni0.03Mo0.97B2, and hardness of Co0.03Mo0.97B2 is 29.5–22.0 GPa from 0.49 N to 9.8 N, which is about 10% higher than β-MoB2. The electrical resistivity of NixMo(1-x)B2 and CoxMo(1-x)B2 reaches 10−7 Ω·m which is about an order of magnitude better than β-MoB2. The better conductivity is attributed to Co/Ni atoms stimulating Mo atoms to offer more free electrons in the structure. This work suggests a new sight of simultaneously enhance hardness and conductivity by doped soft transition metals, and it is significant for the future research of functional hard materials.",International Journal of Refractory Metals and Hard Materials

Electrogenerated quinone intermediates mediated peroxymonosulfate activation toward effective water decontamination and electrode antifouling,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.The activation of peroxymonosulfate (PMS) by redox-active quinones-like compounds has been proposed as a viable approach for water decontamination, which is, however, limited by the secondary pollution associated with ex situ addition of organic activators. Herein, we demonstrated a novel in situ produced quinone intermediates-mediated PMS activation technique for organic decontamination. The parent pollutant (e.g., aniline) was first transformed to quinones-like intermediates by electrooxidation, followed by nucleophilic addition with PMS to initiate the production of singlet oxygen (1O2), which significantly improved the pollutant degradation and mineralization kinetics when compared to conventional electrooxidation technologies.

However, the numbers of exsolved metal NPs are still limited even at high temperatures in reducing environments due to the sluggish kinetics of cations. Herein, an ionic liquid-assisted voltage-driven exsolution strategy at room temperature to prepare the Cu NPs socketed on La1.568Sr0.392Ce0.04NiCuxO4-δ (Cu@LSCNCx, x = 0.05, 0.1, 0.2) with uniform distribution and high density was proposed. When employed as cathodes for Zn-air batteries, the electrochemical performance was significantly enhanced, mainly ascribing to the rich well-dispersed Cu NPs, synchronously generated socketed metal/oxide interfaces and oxygen vacancies, which facilitated the mass transportation and electrons transferring during the charging/discharging process. Specifically, Cu@LSCNC0.05, exsolved using 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide with an applied voltage of -0.6 V, demonstrated the highest peak power density enhancement of about 201% from 42.6 to 128.4 mW·cm−2 compared to the LSCNC0.05 counterpart.

Fast Au-Ni@ZIF-8-catalyzed ammonia borane hydrolysis boosted by dramatic volcano-type synergy and plasmonic acceleration,"© 2022Production of hydrogen (H2) from H2 storage materials is very attractive as a source of sustainable energy. We report that AuNi@ZIF-8 alloys are very efficient nanocatalysts for H2 evolution upon ammonia borane hydrolysis under visible-light illumination with turnover frequency 3.4 times higher than with the monometallic Ni catalyst in the dark. This improvement is attributed to dramatic volcano-type positive synergy optimized in Au0.5Ni0.5 @ZIF-8, for which ZIF-8 is by far the superior support, as well as to the localized surface plasmon resonance induced between 450 and 620 nm.

Rational design and modulation strategies of Mo-based electrocatalysts and photo/electrocatalysts towards nitrogen reduction to ammonia (NH3),"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.As a promising strategy of free energy storage carrier, mainly ammonia (NH3) is produced through the Haber-Bosch process, having extensive requirement of the energy along with the emission of greenhouse gases. However, as a potential Haber-Bosch replacement, the advancement in the photo/electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction process (NRR) is being investigated as a zero-emission electrocatalytic approach by providing alternative routes to achieve green NH3 synthesis.

Multi-sites synergistic modulation in oxygen reduction electrocatalysis,"© 2022Revealing the types of and interplays among multiple active-sites in iron-nitrogen-carbon (Fe–N–C) materials is of great significance for developing high-performance, Fe-based non-precious metal catalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). In this paper, a single-atom Fe–N–C catalyst is prepared through high-temperature pyrolyzing of melamine foam (MF), iron phthalocyanine (FePc), phthalocyanine (Pc), and zinc (Zn)-salts composite. The catalyst is found to contain a variety of active-sites, including carbon atom next to pyridinic-N (pyridinic–N–C), Fe-N4 and pore defect. It is shown that MF with high N-content is responsible for the formation of the main pyridinic–N–C sites and in the meantime acts as the self-sacrificed template for framework of the catalyst. The presence of Pc can facilitate the formation of the predominant Fe-N4 sites, since the interplay between Pc and FePc results in a confinement of Fe-N4. Zn-salts serve as the pore-forming additives to create sufficient pore defects which can also anchor pyridinic–N–C and Fe-N4 structures. The results of density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggest that the multiple active-sites function synergistically to enable high-efficiency ORR electrocatalysis. The optimal Fe–N–C catalyst shows superior ORR activity with a half-wave potential of ∼0.88 V (vs. RHE), as well as high methanol tolerance and electrochemical stability compared to the commercial carbon-supported platinum (Pt/C) catalyst.",Journal of Colloid and Interface Science
Selective C2 electrochemical synthesis from methane on modified alumina supporting single atom catalysts,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.The production of C2 compounds in an aqueous solution by efficient and selective electro-conversion of methane is a challenge and of great significance topic. Here, enhanced catalysts, with tunable electrocatalytic activities with time, for direct and selective oxidation of methane to C2 products (i.e., acetic acid and ethanol) at ambient temperature were prepared by exploiting Rh and Cu single atoms dispersed on NH4BF4 modified Al2O3 nanoparticles exhibiting a large amount of Brønsted acid sites. Brønsted acid sites play a pivotal role in the final formation allowing the direct CO insertion into reaction intermediates. A high acetic acid production, over the Rh-based electrocatalyst, of 33.57 μmol/hcm2 after only 40 min of reaction was obtained. On the other hand, a selective ethanol production rate of 37.14 μmol/hcm2 after 120 min of reaction was achieved over the Cu-based catalyst, thanks to the tendency vs acetyl species formation over copper single atoms. Catalysts activity was kept stable for at least 120 min, at 2 V, and ambient temperature. The comparative analysis with the literature results highlights the high efficiency of our catalysts in selectively promoting acetic acid and ethanol productions with high yields, and stability. A novel way, exploiting single-atoms dispersed on suitable supports, for the production of performing surfaces, was provided.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Noble-metal-free 3D hierarchical Ni-WC heterostructure with enhanced interfacial charge transfer for efficient electrocatalytic hydrodechlorination,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Electrocatalytic hydrodechlorination (EHDC) provides a promising approach to efficiently remove the halogenated organic pollutants in water. Herein, a kind of noble-metal-free three-dimensional (3-D) hierarchical nickel-tungsten carbide (Ni-WC) heterostructure supported on nickel foam (NF) (Ni-WC/NF) was fabricated via the in-situ hydrothermal growth and annealing treatment of Ni,W-rich polyoxometalate {Ni54W72}. Featuring self-supported 3-D hierarchical skeleton structures and abundant Ni-WC interfaces, Ni-WC/NF exhibited high-efficient EHDC performance towards 4-chlorophenol (4-CP) with 100 % conversion efficiency in 3 h, large reaction rate constant of 2.2 × 10-2 min−1 and high current efficiency of 13.9 %, which is comparable to the-state-of-the-art Pd-based catalysts. The active atomic hydrogen (H*) generation kinetics and the interactions of Ni-WC heterostructure with 4-CP/phenol were evaluated. DFT calculations demonstrated that the coverage of 4-CP determines the EHDC efficiency, the Ni-WC heterostructure optimizes the electronic structure of Ni, enhances the adsorption of 4-CP and facilitates the desorption of phenol, thus promoting EHDC performance. This work provides an efficient noble-metal-free catalyst for enhanced electrochemical dechlorination in organic-pollutant treatment.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Hierarchically porous nickel foam supported Fe-Ni3S2 electrode for high-current–density alkaline water splitting,"© 2022 Elsevier Inc.Alkaline water electrolysis (AWE) offers a promising route for green hydrogen production. However, its industrial application is impeded by unsatisfactory energy conversion efficiency. Herein, a robust electrode composed of porous nickel foam (PNF) and Fe-doped Ni3S2 (Fe-Ni3S2) nanosheet arrays was fabricated and applied for industrial AWE. By conducting a scalable dynamic bubble-template method, PNF with high loading of active catalysts was prepared. The superhydrophilicity of PNF facilitates bubble detachment and promotes mass transfer, especially at high current densities. In addition, Fe-Ni3S2 with optimized electronic structure is featured with enhanced electrical conductivity, sufficient exposure of active sites, and optimized adsorption of intermediates. Benefiting from the concerted advantages of PNF and Fe-Ni3S2, the obtained Fe-Ni3S2/PNF-5 electrode with an optimal Fe content of 5 mol% exhibits high catalytic activity for both hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Compared with the Pt/C/NF||IrO2/NF couple, the Fe-Ni3S2/PNF-5||Fe-Ni3S2/PNF-5 couple delivers a current density of 10 mA cm−2 at a low cell voltage of 1.50 V for AWE. Under industrial conditions, a competitive cell voltage of 1.75 V is needed for achieving a high current density of 400 mA cm−2. Besides, the couple can operate stably for 120 h, outperforming the commercial RN||RN couple. This work provides a novel strategy to elevate the loading amount of catalysts and improve the electrochemical performance of the electrode for practical AWE application.",Journal of Colloid and Interface Science
Construction of hetero-phase Mo2C-CoO@N-CNFs film as a self-supported Bi-functional catalyst towards overall water splitting,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.It is an enormous challenge to develop low-cost non-noble metal bi-functional catalysts toward overall water splitting. The efficient water decomposition electrocatalysts need both intrinsic activities determined by electronic structure and superb mass transfer ability. For this, in the contribution, an efficient self-supported bi-functional catalyst, i.e., nanoscale hetero Mo2C-CoO encapsulated in N-doped carbon nanofibers (Mo2C-CoO@N-CNFs), is designed and fabricated with facile electrospinning avenue. Density functional theory and electrochemical investigation manifest that the synergistic effect of bimetallic Mo/Co accelerates kinetics of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and lowers the energy barrier of oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Thanks to the structural and compositional merits, the optimized integrated Mo2C-CoO@N-CNFs film demonstrates remarkable catalytic activities in both OER and HER, and renders a current density of 10 mA cm−2 at 1.56 V when used for alkaline whole water cracking. The design concept here provides insights for future rational construction of advanced water decomposition catalysts.",Chemical Engineering Journal
"Unravelling the formation mechanism and performance of nitrogen, sulfur codoped biochar as peroxymonosulfate activator for gatifloxacin removal","© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Multi-heteroatom doping is a promising approach to increase the affinity of biochar for catalysis. Herein, a series of N, S-codoped biochar (BSN) were synthesized at different temperatures using a one-pot calcination protocol. Investigation on the physiochemical characteristics of these BSNs revealed that g-C3N4 was first formed from the precursors at lower temperature, engulfing the biochar. At higher synthesis temperature, the g-C3N4 decomposed and coalesce with the biochar to form BSN. The performance of BSN as peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activator for gatifloxacin (GAT) removal was evaluated. The results indicated that BSN prepared at 800 °C (BSN-800) exhibited the greatest performance due to its relatively high specific surface area and synergism between heteroatoms. A kinetic model based on the second-order PMS consumption and first-order GAT removal was developed to describe GAT removal and PMS consumption simultaneously at various operating conditions including BSN-800 loading, PMS dosage and pH. The proposed kinetic model has better fit compared to the conventional pseudo first-order kinetics. The major PMS activation mechanism was identified using chemical scavenger and electrochemical studies indicating that the nonradical pathway involving 1O2 generation and electron mediator mechanisms are dominant with graphitic N and thiophenic S acting as the active sites. Despite its restricted reusability, BSN-800 can be used effectively to remove GAT in various water matrixes including river water, secondary water and tap water. The GAT degradation intermediates were identified, and the degradation pathway was also proposed. Overall, this study provides a better understanding on the development of multi-heteroatom-doped biochar as promising catalyst for antibiotics removal.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Nitrogen-rich three-dimensional metal-organic framework microrods as an efficient electrocatalyst for oxygen evolution reaction and supercapacitor applications,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdThe development of a smart and simple “one stone two birds” synthetic strategy to design remarkable electrode material for green energy harvesting and storage has always been challenging. Among the materials, metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) are the most potential hotspot for developing state-of-the-art materials for efficient oxygen evolution and energy storage application because of their fascinating chemical and structural traits. Herein we present a wet chemical method for the synthesis of a binder-free electrocatalyst for oxygen evolution and an admirable supercapacitor electrode. The designed 3D MOF (AgTz-1) exhibits excellent electrocatalytic oxygen evolution activity, with an ultralow overpotential (η) of 196 mV at 10 mA cm−2 and a Tafel slope of 114 mV dec-1. Furthermore, the AgTz-1-based electrode has a high energy density of 49.5 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 545 W kg−1. The results demonstrated not only a benchmark for pristine MOF in electrocatalysis and energy storage but also a novel family of nitrogen-rich MOF to enhance electrocatalytic performance due to significant active sites.",Fuel
Graphene quantum dot enabled interlayer spacing and electronic structure regulation of single-atom doped MoS2 for efficient alkaline hydrogen evolution,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Interlayer engineering of two-dimensional (2D) materials is believed to be a key to enhance their performance for catalysis and other applications. Herein, molybdenum disulfide intercalated with heteroatom-doped graphene quantum dots and individually dispersed Co atoms (GQD/Co-MoS2) is readily synthesized by a one-pot hydrothermal reaction. With better long-term stability, GQD/Co-MoS2 shows comparable catalytic performance as commercial Pt/C catalyst for hydrogen evolution reaction in alkaline medium at low current densities (overpotential of 53 vs 44 mV at 10 mA cm−2) and outperforms Pt/C at high current densities (106 vs 172 mV at 100 mA cm−2). Based on both experimental and theoretical investigations, the outstanding performance is mainly attributed to the enlarged interlayer spacing and electronic coupling at the 0D/2D van der Waals heterojunctions between GQDs and Co-doped MoS2. In principle, a variety of GQD intercalated 2D materials with atomic doping of one or more metallic elements can be similarly synthesized for diverse applications.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Dynamic evolution of structure–activity of anode on lead release and overpotential change in zinc electrowinning,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Anode is the main source of lead (Pb) contaminations in zinc (Zn) electrowinning, also greatly affects the energy consumption due to the high dependence of overpotential for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) on anodic oxide film (AOF). Herein, continuous tracking of the Pb-based anode was conducted for 60 d to reveal the evolution of structure–activity relationship with the growth of AOF. Results showed that three competitive reactions including Pb corrosion reaction, Mn2+ oxidation reaction and OER on the anode had complex interactive influences on the characteristic evolution of AOF as time increased periodically. With the continuous formation and coverage of AOF (PbSO4/ PbO2/MnO2) during the early 15 d, the Pb-based anode exhibited obvious self-protection effects of less Pb released and less MnO2-containing waste generated, which were attributed to the physically blocking effect of AOF against the excessive exposure of Pb surface by the dense and reticular structure and the electrochemically inhibiting effect for the Mn2+ oxidation by abundant Mn3+ and oxygen vacancy (Ov) of MnO2. Density-Functional-Theory (DFT) calculation indicated that the PbSO4 with higher energy band gap (4.19 eV) and lower formation energy (-1.51 eV atom−1) was prone to form and accumulate, which caused increasing voltage and accelerating release of Pb in the late stage due to over-thickness and structure instability of AOF. This study can provide inspiration for the future design or reconstruction of highly effective AOF structure to synergistically reduce pollution generation of Pb and anode slime and decrease OER overpotential.",Chemical Engineering Journal

In the present work, a novel Ni based MOF and its nanocomposite functionalized with multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) is synthesized via solvothermal method. To increase the catalytic activity of the synthesized material, heat treatment of the fabricated MOF is carried out at 673 K for 3 h. For structural, textural and morphological studies different analytical techniques are applied with subsequent utilization of synthesized materials for catalyzing slow oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Amongst all Ni-nitrodopamine (NDA/MWCNTs-a) electrocatalyst displays outstanding catalytic activity at low overpotential of 285 mV, small Tafel slope of 73 mV dec-1, and long-term stability of 24 h surpassing the catalytic proficiency for noble metal oxides such as IrO2 and RuO2.",Fuel
"Indium-based bimetallic clusters anchored onto silicon-doped graphene as efficient multifunctional electrocatalysts for ORR, OER, and HER","© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Exploring efficient, economical, and environmentally friendly multifunctional electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is a prerequisite for the development of renewable energy conversion and storage technologies. Herein, the catalytic performance of indium-based bimetallic clusters anchored onto silicon-doped graphene (In2M2/Si-G, M = Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn) as multifunctional electrocatalysts is investigated systematically by density functional theory methods. All the studied In2M2 bimetallic clusters can be stably anchored onto the Si-G substrate based on the calculated binding energy. Among these materials, In2V2/Si-G and In2Co2/Si-G are expected to be potential trifunctional (ORR/OER/HER) electrocatalysts with the low overpotentials of 0.51/0.76/−0.11 V and 0.56/0.36/−0.09 V, respectively. Emphatically, the electronic structure analysis reveals that such high catalytic activity can be attributed to the synergistic effect between indium and transition metal atoms, which could effectively promote electron transfer between catalyst and reaction species. This work would open a new perspective and provide guidance for designing promising multifunctional electrocatalysts to meet energy demand.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Surface adsorption guided design of semicrystalline nickel-iron hydroxide for highly-sensitive glucose sensing,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Non-enzymatic glucose sensors, using electrochemically active sensing materials, is of great importance to efficiently monitoring and analyzing the glucose concentration in human body fluids in a simple and rapid manner. However, the remaining disadvantages such as complicated fabrication process, relatively lower sensitivity, and poor stability still limit the actual applications of enzyme-free sensors. On the guide of theoretical simulation, herein, we report an ultrafast, simple, and controllable strategy through one-step chemical corrosion of nickel foam (NF), to prepare semicrystalline nickel-iron hydroxide (NiFeOxHy) as an electrochemical glucose sensing platform. Owing to the short etching time, the NiFeOxHy surface coating with a lower crystallinity degree contains a few crystalline domains act as the adsorption sites. Compared to the pristine NF which is not favorable for glucose adsorption, NiFeOxHy/NF sensor exhibits enlarged electrochemical surface area, superior hydrophilic ability and lower charge transfer resistance, thus promoting the surface adsorption of glucose molecules and accelerating the charge transport kinetics during the glucose sensing. Consequently, NiFeOxHy/NF sensor shows an ultrahigh sensitivity of 6004 μA mM−1 cm−2, along with a high glucose selectivity when exposed to various interferents and superior cycling stability. In addition, the etching-derived NiFeOxHy/NF sensor also works in a blood serum sample. This work therefore offers a convenient and rapid approach to sensor fabrication for high-performance glucose detection.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Facet-tunable coral-like Mo2C catalyst for electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Developing efficient and stable transition metal-based electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alkaline media remains a great challenge due to slow water dissociation kinetics. Here, a novel coral-like porous nitrogen-doped Mo2C electrocatalyst (3D Mo2C) derived from ZIF-8 doped with phosphomolybdic acid hydrate (POM) was proposed for the electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction via facet regulation. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations clarified that the Mo2C (0 0 2) facet accelerated water dissociation, while the Mo2C (1 0 1) facet more easily adsorbed H* to generate H2. Thus, Mo2C facets (1 0 1) and (0 0 2) with a suitable ratio showed synergistic effects to exhibit excellent alkaline HER performance. The coral-like porous Mo2C exposed sufficient active sites and facilitated electron and mass transfer to accelerate alkaline HER. The 3D Mo2C (1:1) catalyst exhibited excellent HER activity with a low overpotential of 110 mV and a small Tafel slope of 73.9 mV dec−1 in 1 M KOH.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Towards an ultra-long lifespan Li-CO2: electron structure and charge transfer pathway regulation on hierarchical architecture,"© 2022Lithium-CO2 batteries are recognized as an essential strategy for efficient carbon sequestration and energy storage to achieve carbon neutrality. Their cycle-ability and polarization voltage, however, are hindered by high decomposition voltage (≈4.3–4.5 V) of insulating Li2CO3. Herein, we report a significant advance toward the rational design of self-supporting and ultra-long cycle lifetime cathode for Li-CO2 batteries, dependence on a favorable hierarchical architecture and rich charge transfer constructed by homogeneously distributed MnO2 nanoplates rooted in the MXene surface supported by carbon paper. Detailedly, it exhibits impressive ultra-long-term stability of 1087 cycles (4348 h) with a low polarization gap (≈ 0.47 V) at a high current of 200 μA cm−2, which is outperformed by all the liquid electrolyte-based Li-CO2 batteries reported previously. Electronic structure analysis reveals that facile charge transfer occurs between catalytic surface and Li2CO3, springing from the –OH functional group (in MXene) to MnO2 by –OH⋯O hydrogen bonds, which acts as charge transfer channels, improving the metallicity of Li2CO3 and facilitating its decomposition and extending battery cyclability. This work paves an effective trajectory for the future development of highly efficient cathodes for durable metal-CO2 batteries.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Refining the surface properties of WO2.7 by vacancy engineering and transition metals doping for enhanced alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Anion-exchange membrane water electrolyzer is a promising and green technology for hydrogen production. However, the high energy barriers for the water dissociation step for breaking the strong H[sbnd]O[sbnd]H covalent bond results in sluggish hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) kinetics at the cathode. Herein, we present a strategy to optimize the morphology and surface properties of WO2.7 by introducing oxygen vacancies and doping with various transition metals. The experimental analysis demonstrates that the developed Co-WO2.7-x and Ni-WO2.7-x with ultrafine nanorods structure provide a larger electrochemical surface area than the other synthesized catalysts. Furthermore, theoretical analysis reveals that Co-WO2.7-x has the lowest energy barrier (0.65 eV) for the water dissociation step, which is much lower than that of WO2.7 (2.61 eV). Consequently, the Co-WO2.7-x delivers a current of 10 mA cm−2 at a small overpotential of 59 mV for alkaline HER.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Photo-induced conversion of type-II CoPc/BiOBr-NSs to S-scheme heterostructure for boosting CO2 photoreduction,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.With efficient charge separation, S-scheme heterostructures are very attractive for photocatalytic carbon dioxide reduction, but their construction is still facing challenge. Herein, cobalt phthalocyanine (CoPc) was combined with BiOBr nanosheets (NSs) as type-II heterostructure CoPc/BiOBr-NSs. It is more interesting that light-induced oxygen vacancies on BiOBr-NSs can convert type-II CoPc/BiOBr-NSs to S-scheme structures for CO2 reduction. The optimal CoPc/BiOBr-NSs exhibited significantly enhanced CO generation with rate of 59.9 μmol g−1 h−1 (selectivity of 90.4 %), which was 25-fold higher than that of BiOBr-NSs, and much higher than most reported photocatalysts. Photo-induced oxygen vacancies on BiOBr-NSs can generate defect states on bottom of conduction band (CB), which can trap the electrons to have a recombination with holes left on HOMO band of CoPc, boosting charge separation for efficient CO2 reduction. Moreover, the central Co2+ of CoPc can accept the excited electrons from the ligand to act as active site for CO2 reduction. This work provides a new strategy of constructing metal-complex/semiconductor S-scheme photocatalyst for boosting CO2 photoreduction.",Chemical Engineering Journal
CO2-derived free-standing carbon interlayer embedded with molecular catalysts for improving redox performance in Li-S batteries,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.The use of a free-standing carbon interlayer is a promising approach for the development of lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries because it suppresses the shuttle phenomenon and provides outstanding flexible characteristics. However, the thickness required to maintain the unique properties of the free-standing interlayer inevitably inhibits the transport of Li ions, causing sluggish redox kinetics. This work tackles the critical problem of the interlayer by synthesizing a composite in which Fe-based molecular catalysts are atomically incorporated into carbon nanofibers with superior pore characteristics realized by CO2 treatment. The templates self-generated during CO2 annealing provide high porosity and surface area, leading to effective Li-ion diffusion, and homogeneous distribution of the catalytic sites in the form of Fe-N2 to the free-standing paper. The Fe-N2 configuration thermodynamically aids in overcoming the energy barrier of the rate-limiting step of Li2S4 to Li2S conversion while minimizing the shuttle phenomenon. Based on the effective Li-ion transport by improved pore properties, and the superior redox reaction ability of Fe-N2, the assembled cell maintains a coulombic efficiency of 95% up to 1600 cycles at 3.0 C. In addition, a maximum areal capacity of 2.9 mAh cm−2 is delivered for a high loading electrode with 4.2 mg cm−2 at 45 °C.",Chemical Engineering Journal

With the rise of electrocatalytic NO3− reduction, highly reactive and selective electrodes are essential for the electrochemical reduction of NO3−. In this study, a one-step hydrothermal method was used to load Cu and Cu(OH)2 on Ni foam (NF) (Cu(OH)2-Cu/NF) as a cathode. The system's unique design includes: Cu and Ni can promote the reduction of NO3− and the generation of active hydrogen atom (H*) as a reducing agent. Then, Cu(OH)2 is beneficial to NO2− adsorption and promotes the reduction of NO2− intermediate. Finally, NH4+ is oxidized to N2 by reactive chlorine generated at the anode. The Cu(OH)2-Cu/NF electrode exhibits a 91.5 % conversion of NO3−-N in 90 min, which is 44 times higher than that of NF. Under 2000 mg/L Cl−, NH4+ finally oxidizes to N2 within 360 min, and N2 selectivity is 95.60 %. In addition, the Cu(OH)2-Cu/NF electrode maintained an excellent electrochemical performance after 20 cycles. This study provided a new idea for designing efficient, stable, and inexpensive NO3− reduction electrodes.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Isolated transition metal nanoparticles anchored on N-doped carbon nanotubes as scalable bifunctional electrocatalysts for efficient Zn–air batteries,"© 2022 Elsevier Inc.Accelerating the sluggish anode reaction in a Zn–air battery can improve its energy efficiency, but the large-scale development of this battery is hindered by the lack of bifunctional catalysts. Herein, we designed a one-step carbonization strategy for synthesizing monodispersed Co nanoparticles supported on N-doped carbon nanotube (Co/CNT), which shows excellent bifunctional electrocatalytic performance with long-term durability for oxygen reduction reaction/oxygen evolution reaction. The formation of carbon substrates from the carbonization of nitrogenous organic molecules are benefit to capture more Co nanoparticles though strong metal–substrate interaction, then construct high-density effective active sites of the Lewis base for accelerating the electrocatalytic reaction process. To verify its superior performance, a rechargeable Zn–air battery with a Co/CNT air electrode was subsequently constructed.

Vacancy and strain engineering of Co3O4 for efficient water oxidation,"© 2022Co3O4 has been widely explored in electrocatalysis but seriously limited by its poor intrinsic ability. Defect engineering is an effective method to improve the electrocatalytic ability of catalysts by regulating electronic structure and optimizing the binding energy with surface adsorbates. Herein, in this work we have successfully integrated metal vacancies and tensile strain into Co3O4. With the formation of metal vacancies, the electronic structure of Co3O4 has been regulated. Moreover, the d-band center of Co3O4 has been modulated with the presence of tensile strain. The electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction (OER) ability of the obtained electrocatalyst was improved dramatically. The overpotential to reach 10 mA cm−2 was only 327 mV. Reaction kinetics was rapidly facilitated as indicated by smaller Tafel slope and charge transfer resistance. Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations revealed that the relocated atoms induced the formation of tensile strain and made d-band center of electrocatalyst near to Fermi level leading to enhanced the adsorption to reaction intermediates. What's more, the free energy barrier of rate-determining step (RDS) has been decreased with the integration of metal vacancies and tensile strain. This work provides an efficient strategy to develop defective and effective electrocatalysts.",Journal of Colloid and Interface Science
The polyoxometalates mediated preparation of phosphate-modified NiMoO4−x with abundant O-vacancies for H2 production via urea electrolysis,"© 2022 Elsevier Inc.It is urgent to develop non-noble metal electrocatalysts with both excellent activity and durable stability for H2 production via water electrolysis. Electric energy is mainly consumed by the sluggish anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The electrocatalytic urea oxidation reaction (UOR) has been regarded as a promising reaction to replace OER because of its small thermodynamic oxidation potential. However, developing a facile and large-scale preparation method for bifunctional hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and UOR electrocatalysts is still challenging. Herein, phosphate-modified (4.46 atomic%) NiMoO4−x net-like nanostructures are formed on Ni foam (NF) via H3PMo12O40 etching strategy at room temperature (denoted as NF/P-NiMoO4−x). The etched NF can directly serve as HER electrode, and delivers overpotential of 116 mV at current density of 10 mA/cm2 with Tafel slope of 77.5 mV/dec. Furthermore, it displays excellent UOR activity with potential of 1.359 V at current density of 10 mA/cm2 and Tafel slope of 19.3 mV/dec. The apparent activation energy of NF/P-NiMoO4−x is 20.6 kJ/mol, lower than that of NF (37.7 kJ/mol), indicating smaller apparent barrier for C–N bond cleavage in urea. The cell voltage of urea electrolysis is around 1.48 V for H2 production to deliver current density of 10 mA/cm2, and better long-term stability for 50 h than that of Ir/C||Pt/C. The etching solution can be recycled for five times by addition of H2O2, turning heteropoly blue into its original state. This work develops a facile and large-scale method to prepare bifunctional HER and UOR electrocatalysts for H2 production in a less-energy saving way via urea electrolysis.",Journal of Colloid and Interface Science
Coupling of ruthenium with hybrid metal nitrides heterostructure as bifunctional electrocatalyst for water electrolysis,"© 2022 Elsevier Inc.Noble metal-based materials are the benchmark catalysts for electrocatalysis, but their wide applications are hindered due to their scarcity and high cost. Developing a feasible strategy to achieve higher catalytic activity with low usage of noble metals is vital and urgent. Herein, a simple nitridation route is proposed to design a hybrid material with both ruthenium (Ru) species and mixed metal nitride matrixes (Ru-NiWNx). Benefitting from the intrinsic high conductivity of metal nitrides, abundant catalytic active sites, and strong electron interactions, the Ru-NiWNx catalyst shows excellent bifunctional activity in alkaline electrolytes. The overpotentials are 70 mV and 270 mV at the geometric current density of 100 mA cm−2 for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), respectively. After further assembly into an electrolyzer, the Ru-NiWNx also shows superior performance. The voltage of the electrolyzer only needs 1.49 V to reach 100 mA cm−2 at the test temperature of 80 °C, indicating the promising application for hydrogen production. Our work paves a new strategy to design high-active hybrid materials for overall water splitting.",Journal of Colloid and Interface Science
Directly converting metal organic framework into designable complex architectures with rich co-arranged active species for efficient solar-driven water splitting,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Metal organic frameworks (MOFs) possess large specific surface areas, tunable composition, uniform metal active sites, and open framework structures, showing significant perspective in solar-to-chemical energy conversion. As we already know, Co-based ZIF-67 dodecahedron can be converted to functional Co3O4 and CoP frameworks through annealing means in air or an inert atmosphere. Interestingly, ZIF-67-derived Co3O4 is a typical p-type semiconductor but CoP is an n-type semiconductor. Here, a facile strategy is carried out to evolve polyhedral ZIF-67 with poor photocatalytic reaction toward designable complex architectures for efficient solar-driven water splitting. Specifically, one-step construction of complex functional Co3O4@CoP architecture was successfully implemented firstly in this work, that is, ZIF-67 polyhedrons were transformed into all-in-one Co3O4@CoP frameworks possessing the co-arranging of Co3O4 with CoP species in space, demonstrating the state-of-the-art green processes to construct designable complex architecture based on MOFs. More importantly, the ZIF-67-derived Co3O4@CoP photocatalyst exhibits more excellent photocatalytic water splitting performance in comparison with ZIF-67-derived CoP and Co3O4 as well as previous-best catalysts under identical conditions because of multi-action mechanism synergy.

Simultaneous regulation of Li-ion intercalation and oxygen termination decoration on Ti3C2Tx MXene toward enhanced oxygen electrocatalysis for Li-O2 batteries,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Active and robust bifunctional oxygen catalysts are the crucial factors to commercialize Li-O2 batteries (LOBs). However, most of the reported catalysts lack the competence to consistently achieve low overpotentials toward oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) during long-term cycling under high rates. Here, the bifunctional activity of Ti3C2Tx MXene is subtly motivated by surface engineering via simultaneous regulation of Li-ion intercalation and O termination decoration. The post-treated Ti3C2Tx (t-Ti3C2Tx) MXene catalysts exhibit superior ORR/OER activities to the pristine Ti3C2Tx counterpart, where the conditions of alkalization by 3 M LiOH and annealing under 400 °C offer the optimum performance. The LOB using t-Ti3C2Tx achieves very low ORR/OER overpotentials of 0.16/0.57 V for discharge/charge process, and a large discharge capacity of 17627.3 mAh g−1 at 100 mA g−1, far outperforming that using the pristine Ti3C2Tx (0.19/0.66 V and 13119.7 mAh g−1, respectively). Remarkably, the t-Ti3C2Tx cell achieves unprecedented cycle performances for 300 cycles under the limited capacity of 500 mAh g−1 and 200 cycles under 1000 mAh g−1 at a high rate of 2000 mA g−1, meanwhile outputting the discharge voltages above 2.5 V throughout the whole cycles. The superb catalytic capability of t-Ti3C2Tx is mainly attributed to the synergistic contributions from the uniform O termination groups, abundant intercalated Li ions, expanded interlayer spacing and the consequent increase in active sites for facile formation and decomposition processes of Li2O2 discharge product, and the suppression of excessive oxidation of Ti surface atoms.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Heterojunction engineering of Ni3S2/NiS nanowire for electrochemical hydrogen evolution,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdHydrogen evolution reaction (HER) over the non-noble metal-based electrocatalysts is a promising approach to realize future clean energy economy. Herein, to achieve effective interface construction, epitaxial growth of NiS on the surface of one-dimensional (1D) Ni3S2 nanowire on nickel foam (NF) was performed, to construct a Ni3S2/NiS electrocatalyst with a heterojunction structure via a solid-state phase transformation. Benefiting from the strong charge transfer at the Ni3S2/NiS heterojunction interface, the d-band center was downshifted compared to the single component (Ni3S2 or NiS), which effectively optimized the valence state and the H adsorption of Ni, thus improved the HER activity. The obtained Ni3S2@NiS-250/NF showed the robust HER catalytic performance with a low overpotential of 129 mV to deliver the current density of 10 mA cm−2 with a small Tafel slope (75.5 mV dec-1) in 1 M KOH media. Moreover, it exhibited superior durability for at least 50 h. This work provides a novel strategy for designing nickel sulfide-based catalysts for HER with high performance.",Fuel
Facile synthesis of Fe3C-dominated Fe/Fe3C/FeN0.0324 multiphase nanocrystals embedded in nitrogen-modified graphitized carbon as efficient pH-universal catalyst for oxygen reduction reaction and zinc-air battery,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Iron-based nitrogen-doped carbonaceous materials are currently the most promising alternative towards oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) electrocatalysts due to the highly efficient active sites of single-atom Fe-NX coordination. However, the fact that iron-containing nanocrystals are easier to form during pyrolysis without additional tuning while providing activity comparable to single-atom sites cannot be ignored. Herein, we propose a facile and efficient strategy to synthesize iron nanocrystals sites with multiphase embedded in porous nitrogen-doped graphitized carbon (Fe/Fe3C/FeN0.0324@N-GC-X, X = 700, 850, and 1000). Based on highly active Fe3C@N-GC sites and the synergistic effect of Fe3C-dominated multiple iron-based, Fe/Fe3C/FeN0.0324@N-GC-850 exhibits excellent electrocatalytic activity towards ORR in pH-universal media. Specifically, it exhibits satisfactory onset potential (Eonset), half-wave potential (E1/2) and stability, and thus surpassing the benchmark Pt/C in both alkaline and neutral media as well as approaching Pt/C in acidic media. When employed as an air cathode in zinc-air batteries (ZABs), it also presents higher open-circuit voltage (OCV), discharge voltage plateaus, capacity, and peak power density compared with Pt/C. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrate that Fe3C (2 2 0)/N-GC has lower activation energy during ORR process and the overpotential generated by Fe3C/N-GC (0.7 V) is obviously less than one of Fe/N-GC (1.37 V) and FeN0.0324/N-GC (1.69 V).",Chemical Engineering Journal
Single metal atom anchored on porous boron nitride nanosheet for efficient collaborative urea electrosynthesis: A computational study,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Urea electrosynthesis under ambient conditions has been emerging as a sustainable strategy to replace the harsh industrial process, in which the activation of the inert N2 molecule and the then C[sbnd]N coupling still remain the huge challenge due to the lack of advanced electrocatalysts with multiple active sites. Here, by means of density functional theory (DFT) computations, a new family of electrocatalysts with asymmetrical triple active sites was proposed to boost urea production by anchoring single metal atoms on porous boron nitride nanosheet with divacancy (M/p-BN). Through the high-throughput screening, we found that the anchored Fe and Co atoms exhibit satisfied catalytic activity for urea formation with low limiting potentials, moderate kinetic barriers for C[sbnd]N coupling reaction, and excellent suppressing effect on the side reactions, in which Fe/Co and their adjacent two B atoms perform as collaborative adsorption sites. Furthermore, the high activity of the two promising catalysts can be well rationalized by their optimal binding strength with the NCON* species, which is mainly determined by the intrinsic charge distribution on the active sites. This work suggested that the anchoring of a single metal atom can highly activate BN nanosheet to achieve multiple active sites, which opens a new avenue to develop novel and efficient catalysts for other electrocatalytic reactions.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Review: Two-Dimensional Layered Material Based Electrodes for Lithium Ion and Sodium Ion Batteries,"© 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.Energy crisis is a worldwide problem due to the current conventional resources which are depleting and are causing great environmental concerns. Among many feasible solutions, rechargeable batteries are considered as a powerful alternative to these conventional energy resources. Lithium and sodium ion batteries are one of the best energy storage systems which provide greater cyclic stability and better charge–discharge capacity. These metal ion batteries have achieved great attention and are being used in a range of applications from small electronic devices to electric vehicles. An overall enhancement of metallic ion storage and transportation is the current concern and focus of the researchers. Many electrode materials are tried and tested in this regard which provided great deal of structural and functional improvement. Two dimensional layered materials have also gained much attraction recently in energy storage application due to their higher surface to volume ratio. There are a number of layered structures which have been developed and electrochemically tested as anode or cathode for both lithium and sodium ion batteries. Materials like graphene based structures, transition metal chalcogenides (TMDCs), MXenes, nitrides, Molybdenum Sulfide and organic frameworks showed promising results as electrode for lithium and sodium ion batteries. In this work, an effort is done to cover all these electrode materials along with their complete structural analysis and a thorough evaluation of their electrochemical activity in energy storage systems.",Lecture Notes in Electrical Engineering
Coupling Dual-phased nickel selenides with N-doped carbon enables efficient urea electrocatalytic oxidation,"© 2022 Elsevier Inc.Electrochemical urea oxidation reaction (UOR) is urgently in demand for diverse energy conversion and storage device coupled with pollution treatment because of its favorable thermodynamic potential (0.37 V vs RHE) and wide distribution nature of urea, but simultaneously gravely limited by the sluggish reaction dynamics and poisoning of catalyst. Herein, dual-phased Ni0.85Se/NiSe2 coupling with N doped carbon (Ni0.85Se/NiSe2@NC-2) in situ is prepared by a solvothermal-selenization pathway. Benefiting from the collective promotion of the dual-phased composition and the NC support, Ni0.85Se/NiSe2@NC provides abundant active sites, enhanced electrical conductivity. It delivers a current density of 252 mA cm−2 at 1.6 V vs RHE with a small Tafel slop of 64.4 mV dec-1 and gets a lower reaction barrier. Moreover, it requires a cell voltage of 1.46 V to approach 50 mA cm−2, about 250 mV less than that of water electrolysis, confirming the less energy consumption. Notably, the N doped carbon protects Ni0.85Se/NiSe2 nanocrystals from aggregation leading to a faster CO2 desorption from Ni sites, which endow the Ni0.85Se/NiSe2@NC-2 a much better working stability. The direct urea hydrogen peroxide fuel cell (DUHPFC) achieves a maximum power density of 9.09 mW cm−2 at 20 °C. This work extends highly efficient dual-phased structure loading in NC catalysts system for urea-assisted energy conversion.",Journal of Colloid and Interface Science
Shape-controlled synthesis of Pd nanotetrahedrons with Pt-doped surfaces for highly efficient electrocatalytic oxygen reduction and formic acid oxidation,"© 2022Increasing the accessible active sites and especially improving the intrinsic activity are two major effective strategies for enhancing the electrocatalytic activity of nanomaterials. Accordingly, through the trioctylphosphine (TOP)-based CO-assisted solvothermal method and the small-amount Pt2+ galvanic replacement, highly uniform Pd nanotetrahedrons (NTs) with Pt-doped surfaces are synthesized and supported onto carbon black. Comprehensive experimental and theoretical analyses reveal that, owing to the Pt surface-doped (SD) nanostructure, the conformal formation of surface Pt {111} facets, as well as the strain and electronic effects induced by the Pd–Pt alloy structure, Pd/SDPt NTs/C exhibits much better electrocatalytic performance than Pd NTs/C, commercial Pd/C, and Pt/C toward both oxygen reduction and formic acid oxidation reactions, showing greatly improved metal utilization and area/mass-specific activity. This study develops a high-performance bifunctional electrocatalyst, and firstly introduces TOP as the easy-removable surface-energy adjuster for the Pd shape-controlled synthesis, which may be further expanded to other metals and shapes.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Regulating surface composition of platinum-copper nanotubes for enhanced hydrogen evolution reaction in all pH values,"© 2022 Elsevier Inc.Regulating catalyst composition is one of the efficient approaches to boost intrinsic activity of electrocatalysts for water splitting. Herein, four different hollow porous platinum-copper (PtCu) nanotubes (NTs) with controllable compositions were precisely fabricated by a facile wet-chemistry method. Importantly, Pt5Cu2 NTs display the best hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance in all pH conditions compared to other samples, which just require overpotentials of 34 ± 2, 32 ± 2, and 284 ± 2 mV at 10 mA cm−2 in basic, acidic, and neutral solutions, respectively. Moreover, Pt5Cu2 NTs also exhibit outstanding stability and corrosion resistance in all pH ranges. Then, mechanism analysis reveals that the electronic structure of Pt sites is regulated by changing the ratio of Pt and Cu, which directly optimizes the binding energy of reaction intermediates and promotes electron transfer during the HER process. In addition, a porous nanotube structure with countless nanoparticles on the surface provides a large number of active sites, enhancing the adsorption/desorption of reactants. This work emphasizes the importance of catalyst composition and provides a highly active potential HER catalyst for practical hydrogen production.",Journal of Colloid and Interface Science
Nickel-cobalt Cyclo-tetraphosphate decorated hollow carbon nanocages as effective polysulfide promoters for stable Lithium-Sulfur batteries,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Lithium-sulfur batteries (LSBs) are promising next-generation energy storage systems. The construction of high-efficiency electrocatalysts to overcome the barriers of sluggish lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) conversion and shuttle effect is urgent. Herein, nickel–cobalt cyclo-tetraphosphate (NiCoP4O12) nanoparticles embedded in hollow carbon polyhedrons are elaborately prepared and used as excellent polysulfide promoters in LSBs. The well-controlled core–shell structure physically blocks and strongly captures LiPSs, thereby boosting LiPSs conversion kinetics over the large exposed NiCoP4O12 active sites. Meanwhile, the carbon matrix build a conductive network that enables high-speed electron and ion transport, thus forming a rapid and robust “capture-diffusion-transformation” network. As a result, the assembled S@NiCoP4O12 cathode delivers an excellent rate capacity (518.7 mAh g−1 at 5 C), impressive stability (a small capacity decay of 0.0396 % per cycle over 1500 cycles at 1 C), and favorable durability of thick sulfur cathodes under lean electrolyte condition (with 4.13 mg cm−2 sulfur loading and 5.0 µL mg−1 electrolyte) over 120 cycles.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Boosting photocatalytic reduction of the diluted CO2 over covalent organic framework,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Photocatalytic reduction of the diluted CO2 into the value-added chemicals and fuels is one of promising approaches for the utilization of anthropogenic CO2, but it is still great challenges to achieve high photocatalytic efficiency. Herein, we reported covalent organic framework nanosheets (CON) containing bis-chelating Ni coordination sites for selective photoreduction of the diluted CO2 (15 %). X-ray absorption and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy fine structure analysis corroborate chemical environments of Ni active sites. Strong bis-chelation with metal active sites improves the stability and conjugation degree of CON, which promise high CO production of 8721 μmol g−1 in 2 h with 95 % selectivity over H2 generation in the diluted CO2. The apparent quantum efficiency over Ni-TP-CON is 1.2 % upon 420 nm irradiation with CO turnover number of 28.7 in 5 h in the atmosphere of 15 % CO2. The experimental and theoretical results show that bis-chelating metal coordination units in CON are more favorable active sites for the diluted CO2 photoreduction when compared with mono-chelating coordination mode, which effectively reduces the energy barrier, expedites the formation of reaction radicals *COOH and facilitates the charge transportation. Our findings provide prospects toward the application of bis-chelating metal coordination modes in solar-to-chemical energy conversion.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Interface charge induced self-assembled (Co(OH)2)4@La(OH)3 heterojunction derived from Co4-MOF@La(HCO2)3 to boost oxygen evolution reaction,"© 2022Interface engineering as an effective material modification method can regulate local corresponding interfacial geometry and electronic structures, thus enabling a higher intrinsic activity for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Herein, we carefully designed p-p heterojunction precursor Co4-MOF@La(HCO2)3 with internal electric field through electrostatic adherence, which then in-situ transformed into p-p type heterojunction electrocatalyst (Co(OH)2)4@La(OH)3 under KOH activation strategy. The one-step in-situ conversion of (Co(OH)2)4@La(OH)3 generated the interface with significant difference in metal atomic radius and exhibits fascinating nanostructures, which enhances the specific surface area and increases the number of active sites compared with the parent material. Impressively, the obtained material (Co(OH)2)4@La(OH)3 demonstrates satisfying electrocatalytic activity in OER with a low overpotential of only 233 mV to reach a current density of 20 mA cm−2, and excellent stability for 50 h at 10 mA cm−2 in alkaline medium. In-situ Raman technique indicates that multivalent Co centers are the true active sites during the OER process. Based on density functional theory (DFT) calculation results, La atoms possess empty d orbitals, which are beneficial to facilitate charge transfer from Co to La at the heterojunction interface. Meanwhile, the introduction of La atoms changes the coordinated environment around the adjacent atoms at the interface, which induces the upshift of the d-band center for Co atoms and increases the binding strength of the adsorbed oxygen intermediate.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Metal doping and Hetero-engineering of Cu-doped CoFe/Co embedded in N-doped carbon for improving trifunctional electrocatalytic activity in alkaline seawater,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.The development of high-performance and robust electrocatalyst suitable for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR), and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in seawater still faces huge challenges. In this study, Cu-doped CoFe/Co encapsulated by N-doped carbon (Cu-CoFe/Co/NC) is synthesized via chemical precipitation followed by carbonization method, in which the electronic structure and d-band center of Cu-CoFe/Co/NC are regulated by metal doping and hetero-engineering. The as-synthesized Cu-CoFe/Co/NC exhibit excellent electrocatalytic activity for ORR (E1/2 = 0.87 V), HzOR (η10 = 281 mV), and HER (η-10 = 217 mV) in alkaline seawater. Inspiringly, the self-assembled direct hydrazine fuel cell (DHzFC) are used to power overall hydrazine splitting (OHzS) for proof of concept, demonstrating the great potential of Cu-CoFe/Co/NC as trifunctional electrocatalyst toward energy storage and conversion devices.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Atomic Pt clusters on Au dendrite for formic acid oxidation,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.The minimization of Pt loadings on Au via facile fabrication methods remains a grand challenge in the development of commercially viable electrodes for direct formic acid fuel cells. Herein, we report a simple electrochemical strategy to prepare atomic Pt clusters on Au dendrites supported by carbon paper (CP) as a gas diffusion electrode. At highly negative deposition potentials, Pt deposition is autonomously quenched by immediate adsorption of discharged proton (H) on Pt surface, while highly roughened Au dendrites lead to resistance–capacitance delay for the transient cathodic current. As a result, the suppressed Pt nucleation and self-terminated Pt growth allows for the formation of isolated Pt sites on Au dendrites. The Pt/Au/CP with an ultra-low Pt loading of 5.0 μgPt/cmgeo2 demonstrates high selectivity for direct pathway of formic acid oxidation reaction (FAOR), owing to the ensemble effect. A gradual increase of FAOR activity is observed during cycling test and then, the 20 cycled Pt/Au/CP shows remarkable FAOR activity in half-cell test, exceeding state-of-the-art Pt-Au catalysts. Theoretical calculation indicates that the stabilized intermediate on Pt clusters accelerates the direct FAOR pathway. CO chemisorption analysis reveals that the isolated Pt sites remain stable throughout the reaction. Single cell test for direct formic acid fuel cell with 20 cycled Pt/Au/CP anode demonstrate two-order higher Pt mass activity and mass power density, compared with values reported in recent literature.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Design strategies of perovskite nanofibers electrocatalysts for water splitting: A mini review,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Electrochemical water splitting, as a promising energy conversion technology, is entirely limited by the slow reaction kinetics due to the large overpotentials for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in the anode and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in the cathode. Perovskite oxide nanofibers have been established as one of the most promising catalysts for water electrolysis due to their simple preparation procedure, unique one-dimensional morphology, high specific surface area, controllable nano-size effect, and adjustable compositions. In this review, we firstly systematical summarize the designing strategies, such as electronic structure control (heteroatom doping and lattice oxygen activation), surface/interface engineering, and defect engineering for perovskite nanofiber electrocatalysts to enhance the water electrolysis performance. Based on the OER/HER descriptors and catalytic reaction mechanisms, we further discuss in-depth the significant detail of developing perovskite nanofibers as high-performance OER/HER catalysts to achieve practical application of water electrolysis, including recent advances in bifunctional catalysts for promoting the electrocatalytic activity for OER and HER. Finally, we present new insights for establishing rational OER/HER mechanism and future directions for developing next-generation perovskite nanofiber-based bifunctional catalysts.",Chemical Engineering Journal
New electron transfer bridge construction between Ni3(HTTP)2 and graphene oxide layers for enhanced electrocatalytic oxidation of tetracycline hydrochloride,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Electron transfer capability as crucial properties of anode is directly related to electrocatalytic performance. However, the contributions of electron transfer were always under estimated due to the ambiguous mechanism of electrocatalysis. In this paper, a new electron transfer bridge was constructed in Ni3(HTTP)2/GO to provide a new insight into electrocatalytic performance enhancement. The contributions of active sites candidates, including metal sites, ligands (metal bridging atoms), and electron transfer bridges were innovatively separated. As replacement experimental results (of metal sites and metal bridging atoms), both metal sites and metal bridging atoms contributed slightly as the active center directly for the electrocatalytic degradation of tetracycline hydrochloride (TCH). The great improvement was attributed to the generation of “GO-C-O-S-C-Ni3(HTTP)2” bridges, in which S atoms from ligands were critical anchoring sites for the connection of two 2D layers (Ni3(HTTP)2 and GO layer). The experimental and density functional theory results showed Ni3(HTTP)2 could donate electrons to GO layers, leading the electrostatic imbalance of charge density to facilitate electron withdrawal from pollutions (not only TCH, but also dyes and complex microbial flora). The results of this paper provide a new strategy for improving electrocatalytic efficiency by adjusting electron transfer for novel practical applications of Ni3(HTTP)2/GO composites.",Chemical Engineering Journal
"The critical role of A, B-site cations and oxygen vacancies on the OER electrocatalytic performances of Bi0.15Sr0.85Co1−xFexO3−δ (0.2 ≤ x ≤ 1) perovskites in alkaline media","© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Development of perovskite-type electrocatalysts with high activity, excellent durability and affordable cost provides a promising solution to promote commercialization of clean energy technologies. Here we prepared Bi0.15Sr0.85Co1−xFexO3−δ (x = 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1) perovskites by the conventional solid-state reaction route, and investigated their OER electrocatalytic activity and durability in 0.1 M KOH solution to reveal the critical role of A, B-site cations and oxygen vacancies. Results show the OER activity decreases with increasing x. The optimum composition, BiSC0.8F0.2, presents impressive electrocatalytic performances with low overpotential (330 mV on rotation disk electrode, and 283 mV on carbon paper electrode at 10 mA/cm2) and excellent long-time durability showing a small increase in the overpotential of 17 mV in 167.5 h. Comprehensive analysis and discussion on the bulk and surface properties reveal the critical role of A, B-site cations and oxygen vacancies on OER, and interrelations of Co2+ fraction, oxygen non-stoichiometry and the OER overpotential have been established. Most importantly, a highly A-site deficient surface layer is found on the as-synthesized perovskite, which facilitate OER by exposing more active B-site cations. This work not only reports a promising OER electrocatalyst with high activity and superior durability, but also provides perspectives on relational design for highly efficient and stable perovskite electrocatalysts for OER using solid-state reaction method.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Molybdenum atomic sites embedded 1D carbon nitride nanotubes as highly efficient bifunctional photocatalyst for tetracycline degradation and hydrogen evolution,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Metal single atom catalysts (MSACs) stabilized by nitrogen in carbon nitride are intriguing photocatalysts for energy and environmental applications. However, the synergistic effect of simultaneously tailoring the carbon nitride nanostructure and fabricating single metal atoms has not been explored for photocatalysis. Herein, we report the facile synthesis of Mo atomic sites on porous carbon nitride nanotubes (Mo1@CNNTs) obtained by template free polymerization of urea and melamine monomers. AC-HAADF-STEM image confirmed the existence of isolated Mo atoms, while XAS analysis revealed the formation of unique atomic Mo-N3 structures on CNNTs. Incorporation of Mo atomic sites into CNNTs modulated electronic and band structure and thus improved light harvesting, charge separation, and transfer. The synergy of 1D nanotube structure and distinct atomic Mo sites turned Mo1@CNNTs as a highly efficient bifunctional photocatalyst for hydrogen evolution and tetracycline degradation. On one side Mo1@CNNTs demonstrated hydrogen evolution rate of 4861 µmol.h−1.g−1, while on the other hand Mo1@CNNTs achieved 97.3% TC degradation under visible light irradiation. DFT investigations revealed that induction of unique Mo atomic sites not only tuned the electronic structure of CNNTs, but also localized photoexcited electrons around Mo atoms to activate O2(ads) and generate reactive species (.O2–/.OH) for TC degradation. We believe that our findings are promising and will open new opportunities for the design of novel photocatalyst for a sustainable future.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Fundamental study on oxidation properties at elevated pressure of typical renewable synthetic liquid fuels through low-temperature CO2 electroreduction,"© 2022Using renewable energy to convert CO2 into liquid fuels is a game changing technology that makes transportation and industrial fuels independent of fossil energy. Electrochemical reduction of CO2 is such an example. Liquid fuels produced through this route can be potential candidates for internal combustion engine in the future. However, organic acids such as acetic acid and formic acid will be formed during this process inevitably. To understand oxidation properties of these renewable synthetic fuels, a newly developed variable pressure laminar flow reactor has been used for experimental investigations, and methanol experiments have been performed to validate the reliability of this platform. Pure ethanol and binary fuel experiments have been carried out at 700–1000 K, 10 bar and Φ = 0.25. Several kinetic models obtained from literature has been validated against experimental data and further used for kinetic analysis. Through comparison of experimental results, formation rates of intermediates such as hydrogen, carbon monoxide, methane and acetaldehyde at lower temperature setpoints are larger in pure ethanol experiments than that in binary fuel. This is because acetic acid consumes reactive radicals and then produce less reactive methyl radical, which directly competes with H-abstraction reactions of ethanol. Furthermore, the H-abstraction reaction products of acetic acid will consume methyl radical, this chain-terminating reaction in addition to the consumption of reactive radicals reduce the low-temperature reactivity of the whole system. At higher temperature, stable species formed by acetic acid will be consumed, which makes the concentration of four aforementioned intermediates higher in binary fuel experiments at intermediate to high temperature region. Present work will be conductive to understanding direct usage of renewable synthetic liquid fuels in engine. Further investigation of synthetic fuels can be proceeded based on results of present work.",Fuel
Ligand-free synthesis of noble metal nanocatalysts for electrocatalysis,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Noble metal nanocatalysts have shown excellent activities for electrocatalysis. The commonly used method to synthesize these nanocatalysts is the colloidal synthesis, during which ligands are necessary. The problem in the colloidal synthesis is that post treatments (such as thermal annealing) are usually needed to remove the residual ligands to clean the surface of nanocatalysts. These post treatments could alter the surface structure of the prepared NPs and deactivate the catalytic performance. Therefore, it is interesting to directly prepare the catalysts with ligand-free properties. In fact, ligand-free synthesis of noble metal nanocatalysts has attracted much attention during the past decade. In this review we comprehensively overview the ligand-free synthesis of noble metal nanocatalysts and their electrocatalytic applications. Three synthetic methods for ligand-free synthesis (stabilization by small molecule, stabilization by modified support and constructing self-supported NPs) are classified and typical examples are given. The advantages and disadvantages of these synthetic methods are compared. Different approaches to characterize the ligand-free property of synthesized noble metal nanocatalysts are introduced and compared. Because of the ligand-free property of the synthesized nanocatalysts, they often exhibit excellent electrocatalytic activities. Therefore, the applications of as-synthesized ligand-free nanocatalysts for energy-related electrochemical reactions are summarized: liquid fuel oxidation reaction (LFOR), oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR), nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR). Ligand-free synthetic process is often simple and efficient, which largely reduces the cost of catalyst synthesis, and can be more suitable for industrial production. However, there are still some problems to be solved in the future. Therefore, we point out the current underlining problems and give the perspectives in this emerging field.",Chemical Engineering Journal
High-entropy oxides for catalysis: A diamond in the rough,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.The notion of “entropy engineering” has breathed new life into the research and development of sophisticated functional materials in recent years. High-entropy materials (HEMs) have garnered considerable attention in environmental science and renewable energy technology because of their distinctive structural characteristics, customizable element composition, and tunable functional capabilities. Among them, previous research has shown that high-entropy alloys (HEAs) have many advantages over traditional single-component alloys in terms of model, composition design, microstructure control, and performance. However, systematic research on high-entropy ceramics (HECs) is still relatively lacking, especially for their functional applications and mechanism disclosure. Notably, recent research indicates that high-entropy oxides (HEOs), which belong to HECs, exhibit the potential to be next-generation catalysts since they inherit the “four core effects” of HEAs (high-entropy effect, delayed diffusion effect, lattice distortion effect, and cocktail effect). This review briefly discusses the basic notion of HEOs and their synthesis methods, emphasizing the advantages of their structural characteristics as catalysts (high oxygen mobility, plentiful oxygen vacancies, and efficient dispersion of metal elements). Further, we provide a comprehensive overview of recent achievements in thermal/photo/electrocatalysis involving HEOs. By comparing the catalytic performance of HEOs to that of conventional low/medium-entropy metal oxides, we highlight their advantages as novel functional catalytic materials with excellent catalytic activity, abundant catalytic active sites, and high-temperature stability. Finally, the prospects and remaining obstacles for the selection and production of HEOs in functional catalytic materials, as well as general guidelines for the engineering development of HEOs are discussed.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Halloysite nanotube confined interface engineering enhanced catalytic oxidation of photo-Fenton reaction for aniline aerofloat degradation: Defective heterojunction for electron transfer regulation,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Aniline aerofloat (AAF), as a major flotation reagent widely employed in beneficiation process, has been ignored with persistent toxicity and unsatisfied smell to environment. Herein, a spatial confinement of HNTs@MoS2/Fe was constructed by in situ growth of defects-rich MoS2/FeOOH in-and-out of halloysite nanotubes (HNTs) for completely degradation of AAF. The results showed that ∼ 99 % of AAF was degraded within 60 mins photo-Fenton reaction and the Kobs was calculated 0.223 min−1 which is much higher than recent reports. Interestingly, HNTs@MoS2/Fe can adjust the pH of reaction system to maintain it within a suitable range for highly efficient AAF degradation even at the initial pH 7. TEM images showed that the particle size of MoS2/FeOOH hybrids was 10–50 nm which is very beneficial to decrease the diffusion distance of ROS to avoid self-consumption. XPS and EPR results confirmed that the catalyst with unsaturated S edges and defects effectively promoted the active sites and electron transfer. More importantly, the separated electrons regulated the Mo4+/Mo6+ and Fe3+/Fe2+ cycle which maintained H2O2 decomposition for stable ROS generation. The regenerated Fe2+ and Mo4+ played dual role for H2O2 decomposition to generate ROS. The DFT calculation proved the S defects and FeOOH heterojunction facilitate photogenerated electrons to fast migrate from MoS2 to FeOOH and achieve e-/h+ separation, this is the major driving force for maintaining the generation of ROS in photo-Fenton system. This work will provide an ingenious idea to prepare HNTs confined catalyst with low cost and high durability for removal refractory organic pollutants.",Chemical Engineering Journal
"Methylene blue adsorption derived thermal insulating N, S-co-doped TiC/carbon hybrid aerogel for high-efficient absorption-dominant electromagnetic interference shielding","© 2022 Elsevier B.V.The development of absorption-dominant electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding materials with high-efficiency EMI shielding effectiveness (SE) and low reflection (R) is crucial but challenging for next-generation electronics devices and telecommunication. In this regard, a facile and environmentally friendly approach was proposed to fabricate N, S-co-doped TiC/carbon hybrid aerogels with hierarchically porous architecture through MXene/cellulose hybrid hydrogels as precursors for adsorbing dyes, followed by freeze drying and carbonization process. Profiting from the synergistic effect of highly interconnected three-dimensional (3D) porous structure, heterogeneous conductive network with greatly conductive difference as well as heteroatoms-doping induced dipole polarization, the resultant aerogel with an ultra-low density (47.1 mg/cm3) achieves a highly efficient EMI SE of 84.3 dB at 12.4 GHz (average 81.8 dB in the X-band) and a superior absorption coefficient of 0.68 simultaneously. Meanwhile, the highly porous structure endows the prepared aerogels with outstanding thermal insulating capacity, which is essential to provide infrared stealth and radar stealth for military equipment and to protect sensitive electronic devices from high-temperature attacks. This work offers a prospective strategy for constructing high-performance absorption-dominated EMI shielding materials with excellent thermal insulation properties, and the obtained aerogels present broad application prospects in the fields of aviation, portable electronic equipment and national defense industry.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Carbon matrix with atomic dispersion of binary cobalt/iron-N sites as efficient peroxymonosulfate activator for organic pollutant oxidation,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Monometallic single atom catalysts have exhibited excellent catalytic capacity due to their unique structural features. However, it remains challenging to promote the limited number of active sites and realize high-efficiency and stability during Fenton-like catalysis. Herein, a nitrogenized graphitic carbon matrix containing Fe-Co dual single atoms (FeCoNC) manifested enhanced catalytic capacity in persulfate activation for tetracycline hydrochloride (TC) oxidation. Nonradical singlet oxygen (1O2) was identified as dominant reactive species in both FeCoNC and CoNC systems, while the formation pathways of 1O2 and TC catalysis processes were distinct different. 57Fe Mössbauer spectroscopy and theoretical calculations revealed that the dynamic electronic structure and covalency of Fe-N/Co-N bond configuration after coordinating with a second neighboring metal atom induced promoted electron transfer and tuned reactive species transformation pathways. Benefiting from the optimized N3-Fe-Co-N3 structure and synergistic effect of dual metal sites, the FeCoNC catalyst was endowed with lowered reaction barriers, excellent adaptability and stability, demonstrating promising practical application potential. This work unveiled the intrinsically regulated mechanism of dual single metal sites towards refractory organic oxidation and delivered enhanced understanding of covalency and electronic configuration on PMS-AOPs based catalysis processes.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Well-dispersed cobalt nanoparticles encapsulated on ZIF-8-derived N-doped porous carbon as an excellent peroxymonosulfate activator for sulfamethoxazole degradation,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.The practical application of carbon materials supported cobalt (Co)-based heterogeneous materials as excellent peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activators has attracted wide attention in recent years because of their low particle self-agglomeration and low Co leaching. Herein, we developed a new synthetic strategy for designing Co nanoparticles (Co NPs)-encapsulated zeolitic imidazolate frameworks-8-derived porous carbon (NC) (denoted as Co-N@NC-x) by calcinating NC with a polydopamine-chelating Co coating. It was demonstrated that NC could effectively prevent Co agglomeration because it provided rich load sites for Co. Raman and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy results indicated that the addition of Co could increase the surface defects of NC. Co-N@NC-90 (0.1 g/L) efficiently catalyzed PMS to degrade >96.91 % of sulfamethoxazole (SMX, 20 mg/L) within 90 min with an initial pH of 3.65–9.05 based on the synergistic effect between Co NPs and NC. It was demonstrated that Co NPs were the main active sites, and the defects and carbonyl (C[dbnd]O) group active sites also contributed to SMX degradation by catalyzing PMS. Graphitic N was an adsorption site for SMX. A singlet oxygen (1O2)-dominated non-radical mechanism has been proposed. Additionally, Co-N@NC-90 exhibited excellent stability resulting from NC encapsulation. This work provides a novel approach for the application of metal organic framework-derived carbon-supported metal catalysts in wastewater purification.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Microenvironment engineering of Fe-single-atomic-site with nitrogen coordination anchored on carbon nanotubes for boosting oxygen electrocatalysis in alkaline and acidic media,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Developing cost-effective and high-performance non-precious electrocatalysts for ORR in acidic and alkaline media is an urgent need for clean energy generation. A significant improvement in the ORR performance has been realized by the single-atom catalysts (SACs). However, activity deterioration caused by the dissolution of catalyst structure is still a lingering challenge. Herein, we report a simple strategy for protecting the structure of SAC by implanting/decorating Fe-ZIF-derived carbon nanotubes with Fe-N4, denoted as FeSA@CNTs. The as-developed FeSA@CNTs catalyst exhibits an outstanding ORR activity in an alkaline medium with onset potential (Eo) = 0.998 V and half-wave potential E1/2 = 0.898 V, which are 28 mV and 29 mV higher than commercial 20% Pt/C, respectively. Moreover, FeSA@CNTs in an acidic medium show an impressive high half-wave potential (E1/2 = 0.8290 V) comparable to Pt/C (E1/2 = 0.8292 V) which is better than most recently reported ORR catalysts. The density functional theory (DFT) validates that the smaller difference in the energy orbitals of Fe in Fe-N4 and O2 improved the electron transfer onto the reaction intermediate (OH*) in the rate-determining step, which provides the higher catalytic activity for FeSA@CNTs' in both acidic and alkaline media.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Calcination temperature regulates non-radical pathways of peroxymonosulfate activation via carbon catalysts doped by iron and nitrogen,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Switching the reaction routes between radical pathways and non-radical ones in peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation has attracted much interest, however, the regulation between non-radical pathways remains elusive. Herein, we reported the regulation of the dominant non-radical routes in PMS activation with carbon catalysts doped by iron and nitrogen (Fe-N/C) through varying the calcination temperature of conductive polymer Fe-polyaniline complexes. High calcination temperatures ranging from 300 °C to 900 °C boosted the catalytic activity and surprisingly switched the non-radical activation routes from electron transfer to singlet oxygen (1O2) and high-valent iron-oxo species (HV–Fe[dbnd]O). Pyrrolic N and C[dbnd]O formed at 300 °C accounted for the electron transfer process, while graphitic N, O–C[dbnd]O, and Fe–Nx formed over 700 °C were key catalytic sites responsible for the production of 1O2 and HV–Fe[dbnd]O. Moreover, the catalyst calcinated at 900 °C (900@Fe-N/C-2) maximized bisphenol A removal by 96.4% and TOC removal by 83.0%. The optimal 900@Fe-N/C-2/PMS system could work efficiently over a wide pH range or coexisting water components. This study provided a facile strategy to regulate PMS non-radical pathways for the treatment of complicated wastewater.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Ir nanodots decorated Ni3Fe nanoparticles for boosting electrocatalytic water splitting,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Developing low-cost and high-performance electrocatalysts for water splitting is crucial for advancing the hydrogen production. However, the large-scale practical application is highly dependent on the use of precious catalysts (such as IrO2 and Pt/C). Herein, a composite of Ir nanodots (7.7 wt%) decorated Ni3Fe alloy on reduced graphene oxide (Ir/Ni3Fe/rGO) is prepared via an impregnation-reduction method as a bifunctional electrocatalyst for overall water splitting. The low-content decoration enables the composite to exhibit attractive electrocatlytic performances: requiring overpotentials of 254 and 36 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm−2 for the oxygen and hydrogen evolution reactions (OER and HER) in 1.0 M KOH solution, respectively, which surpass those of Ni3Fe/rGO (280 and 264 mV) and Ir/rGO (340 and 150 mV). In addition, the electrocatalyst-assembled Ir/Ni3Fe/rGO||Ir/Ni3Fe/rGO electrolyzer affords a decent cell voltage of 1.570 V at a current density of 10 mA cm−2 for overall water splitting, which outperforms those of Ni3Fe/rGO||Ni3Fe/rGO (1.730 V), Ir/rGO||Ir/rGO (1.790 V), and commercial IrO2||Pt/C (1.574 V). Furthermore, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) result reveals the strong interfacial interaction between Ir and Ni3Fe species, density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that Ir species favor water dissociation and optimize the H* adsorption energy for HER, and reduce OOH* energy for OER; all of which give rise to the observed enhancement. The results can provide an effective strategy for designing and preparing low-cost and promising electrocatalysts for water splitting.",Chemical Engineering Journal

Herein, a facile one-step electro-deposition strategy is developed to synthesize a novel phase-separated NiCu/NiMn(OH)2 nanocomposite (NiCuMn). Theoretical and experimental results demonstrate that low electronegativity Mn trigger the formation of low valence state Niδ+ in NiMn(OH)2 to accelerate the Volmer step while Cu can optimize the d-band center of NiCu alloy to facilitate the Heyrovsky/Tafel step. Benefiting from this steering of elementary steps by the synergistic components, the obtained NiCuMn nanocomposite achieves ultralow overpotential of 17 and 62 mV to drive 10 and 100 mA cm−2 in 1 M KOH, respectively, and ultrahigh turnover frequency of 0.78 s−1 at overpotential of 100 mV. Moreover, NiCuMn exhibits outstanding durability with a slight potential degradation after 10,000 cyclic voltammetric test.

Herein, flower-like and pure-phase supported nickel phosphide catalysts were controllably fabricated through a hydrotalcite strategy with red phosphorous as the P source. The PR hydrogenation activity of the catalysts followed the order of Ni2P/Al2O3 > NiP2/Al2O3 > Ni/Al2O3 > imp-Ni2P/Al2O3 catalysts (prepared by the impregnation method). Such enhanced performance of Ni2P/Al2O3 could be ascribed to small nickel phosphide particle size and rich active Niδ+ species. Notably, the sulfur contents of PR were effectively reduced from 55.4 (C5PR) and 72.3 ppm (C9PR) to 3.8 and 7.9 ppm after hydrogenation by Ni2P/Al2O3. Meanwhile, Ni2P/Al2O3 also exhibited good stability with the hydrogenation degree of HC5PR maintaining at 94.39 % after 100 h.

Micro-meso hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolite supported RuOx nanoparticles for activity enhancement of catalytic vinyl chloride oxidation,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolites were synthesized by an alkali hydrothermal treatment strategy and adopted as support materials for the fabrication of RuOx nano catalysts. The physicochemical properties and catalytic activities for vinyl chloride (VC) oxidation over the resultant RuOx/HZ5-nd (n = 2, 3, 4) catalysts were successfully modulated by the treatment time regulation (2d, 3d and 4d) of ZSM-5 solid.

All these superiorities were recognized as the crucial origin for boosting catalytic oxidation of VC. Especially, the RuOx@HZ5-3d catalyst exhibited the optimum VC oxidation activity with the lowest T50 and T90 (temperature at 50 and 90% conversion) of 275 and 297 °C, which was 22 and 24 °C lower than those of RuOx/HZ5.

Low power consumed PV-electrolysis with CoFeP nanowires for hydrazine-assisted hydrogen production,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Water electrolysis is becoming increasingly important in green hydrogen production. However, it consumes large amount of power due to sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Recently, hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR) attracted significant attention in replacing OER owing to its low oxidation potential. In this study, CoFeP nanowires (NWs) are presented as a novel effective HzOR electrocatalyst. An array of CoFeP NWs was directly synthesized on a cobalt foam (CF) by cation exchange and subsequent phosphorization. Fe doping on CoP changes rate determine step of hydrazine degradation, required less energy of 0.17 eV, confirmed by DFT calculation. Our CoFeP/CF exhibited high HzOR activity with a low potential of −7 mV for generating a current density of 10 mA cm−2 and a Tafel slope of 29 mV dec−1, which is superior to noble metal catalysts. The overall hydrazine splitting (OHzS) of the combined Pt/CF||CoFeP/CF required remarkably low cell potential of only 63 mV to generate a current density of 10 mA cm−2. Furthermore, the unassisted solar hydrogen production was realized by assembling Pt/CF||CoFeP/CF with a single perovskite solar cell, generating a high current generation of 23 mA cm−2. This value is about two times higher than that of an unassisted overall water splitting system with a solar to hydrogen efficiency of 13.1%, confirming a great potential of our OHzS system in lowering power consumption of electrolysis.",Applied Surface Science

During the long-term operation at 10 mA cm -2, the potential presents almost no attenuation after 21 h. For HER, the η10 is only 85 mV with superior stability of 108 h. The water electrolyzer which is conducted with HEA/JMPA as both cathode and anode in 1 M KOH (HEA/JMPA (+, -)) exhibits excellent overall water splitting activity. The voltage of HEA/JMPA (+, -) to reach 100 mA cm−2 is only 1.75 V and the current density is as high as 305 mA cm−2 at 1.9 V.

However, the existing multiple-step screening methods for NRR electrocatalysts are inefficient, and it is urgent to search for suitable descriptor to shorten screening process. Herein, by density functional theory (DFT) calculation, the structures, electronic structures and NRR activity of TM3C24X12 (TM-X MOF, TM = Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, and Mo, X = NH, and S) are investigated, and a descriptor relevant to magnetism Δ(μB_TM-μB_X) is proposed. An “inverted-volcano” relationship between Δ(μB_TM-μB_X) and ΔGN2→NNH reflects direct relevancy between the descriptor and N2 activation capability, leading the way to the two-step screening method. Mo-S MOF is predicted to be the best among catalysts prefer end-on N2 adsorption according to the descriptor, which is verified via a modified three-step screening method, showing that Mo-S MOF has a low limiting potential of −0.41 V and a satisfying activation energy of 0.85 eV in the determining step.

In addition, Ni/NiO150 exhibits a negligible current attenuation after 25 h amperometric operation, indicating outstanding stability. Furthermore, the synchrotron X-ray adsorption spectroscopy results demonstrate that, the introduction of metal Ni phase could induce electronic interaction at the heterojunction interface, which plays a crucial role in the catalytic performance enhancement. Further, density functional theory calculations were carried out to reveal the mechanism of optimized conductivity and catalytic activity enhancement caused by interface effect.

Two-Dimensional metal-free compounds of BC4N and BC6N2 with boron atoms as highly efficient catalytic centers toward sulfur redox in lithium-sulfur batteries,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries are considered as ideal next-generation energy storage devices, the commercial applications of them are hindered by their inherent drawbacks of shuttle effect and sluggish conversion among lithium polysulfides (LiPs). To tackle these issues, significant research efforts have been devoted to designing high-performance metal-based catalysts implemented in the sulfur cathodes, which however face the challenges of source scarcity and cycling instability. Here, based on first-principles calculations, we investigated our previously predicted two-dimensional (2D) metal-free boron-containing catalysts of BC4N and BC6N2 and found that they possess strong trapping capability for LiPs adsorption energy as low as −6.41 eV beneficial for suppressing shuttle effect. Moreover, BC4N exhibits even superior catalytic performances toward the redox of sulfur, which can be evidenced by the low free energy change of the rate determining step of reduction reaction and small energy barrier of 0.80 eV for Li2S decomposition, outperforming most previously reported metal-based catalysts. Our research can pave a new way for designing new 2D metal-free catalysts in Li-S batteries, which highlights the importance of boron atoms in suppressing shuttle effect and catalyzing sulfur redox.",Applied Surface Science
Coordination environment engineering of graphene-supported single/dual-Pd-site catalysts improves the electrocatalytic ORR activity,"© 2022Coordination engineering is a promising strategy to improve the electrocatalytic ORR activity of single/dual-metal-site catalysts. In this work, the electrocatalytic processes of graphene-supported C, B and N coordination single/dual-Pd-site catalysts were investigated by systematic density functional theory (DFT) calculations, and compared with Pd(1 0 0). The results show that different coordination environments (C, B and N) can strongly affect the adsorption and reaction characteristics of O2 and O-containing intermediates. The B coordination (PdB4/C and Pd2B6/C) catalysts are located in the left region of the volcano, removal of *OH is the potential determining step (PDS), while the C and N coordination (Pd2C6/C, PdN4/C and Pd2N6/C) catalysts are located in the right region, where the formation of *OOH is the PDS. In addition, Pd2B6/C catalyst greatly promote the cleavage of O–O bond, enabling the ORR to occur through both dissociative and associative mechanisms. Among all catalysts, Pd2B6/C stands out with a low overpotential of 0.48 V and shows good ORR performance. Therefore, it has great potential to replace Pt-based catalysts.

The surface functional modification of Ti3C2Tx MXene by phosphorus doping and its application in quasi-solid state flexible supercapacitor,"© 2022The surface modification of MXene by heterogeneous atoms shows great potential in improving the charge storage capacity of MXene. Herein, a strategy of rapid in-situ phosphorus doping at low temperature is demonstrated for preparing functionalized Ti3C2Tx MXene (Ti3C2Tx-P) using sodium hypophosphate as phosphorus source. The phosphorus doping can increase the layer spacing of Ti3C2Tx and yield P[sbnd]O and P[sbnd]C bonds in Ti3C2Tx, resulting in more rapid paths for the migration of electrolyte ions into electrode and more active sites for pseudocapacitance effects. As flexible electrode of supercapacitor, the specific capacitance of Ti3C2Tx-P reaches as high as 476.9F g−1 (745.4F cm−3), which is far larger than that of the raw Ti3C2Tx (344.4F g−1, 438.5F cm−3). In addition, a flexible quasi-solid supercapacitor device assembled by Ti3C2Tx-P film shows high specific capacitance of 103F g−1 at 5 mV s−1. When the power density is 250 W kg−1 and 10000 W kg−1, the corresponding energy density reaches 15.8 Wh kg−1 and 6.1 Wh kg−1, respectively. Therefore, our work not only reveals the role of P atom doping in improving the structure, composition and electrochemical performance of Ti3C2Tx, but provides a method for surface modification and functionalization of MXene materials.",Applied Surface Science
"Ru nanoclusters confined in N, O-codoped porous carbon as robust catalysts for hydrolytic dehydrogenation of NH3BH3","© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Ammonia borane (AB, NH3BH3) hydrolysis is an effective strategy for utilizing sustainable hydrogen energy. However, a suitable catalyst is indispensable because this reaction cannot occur kinetically at ambient temperature. In this work, N, O co-doped hierarchical porous carbon materials are facilely prepared from glucose by using K2CO3 as the activation agent, followed by employing to confine Ru nanoclusters (NCs) for AB hydrolysis. The proper porous structure of PC-5–700 (SBET = 1356 m2 g−1, Vtotal = 0.762 cm3 g−1, Vmicro/Vtotal = 56.0%), which is prepared with a mass ratio of 5: 1 for K2CO3 to glucose and calcined at 700 ℃, are beneficial to the high dispersion of Ru NCs. Additionally, the doped heteroatoms increase the hydrophilicity of the materials, enhancing the active site accessibility in polar solvents. Also, the lone pair electrons of N and O can form chelation with Ru3+ ions, facilitating Ru dispersion and enhancing the surface electronic density. As a result, PC-5–700 confined Ru NCs with a mean size of 1.3 nm display excellent catalytic performance in the hydrolytic dehydrogenation of AB. The corresponding turnover frequency (TOF = 1143.77 min−1) and specific hydrogen evolution rate (rB = 298400 mL min−1 gRu-1) at 30 ℃ in the alkaline solution are superior to many previous results, verifying a promising potential in the hydrolysis of solid-state chemical hydrogen storage.",Applied Surface Science

The results also indicate that NO2 and O2 molecules have a chemisorption process, whereas SO2, NO, CO2, and H2S molecules have found to be of physisorption nature on the nanosheet. Our outcomes show that the GeBi nanosheet might be exceedingly suitable for a highly sensitive sensor for toxic/non-toxic molecular gases.",Applied Surface Science
Bifunctional CuCo2O4/CoOOH as a synergistic catalyst supported on nickel foam for alkaline overall water splitting,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Designing efficient, affordable and stable bifunctional electrocatalysts is critical for electrochemical water splitting. Herein, distinctive CuCo2O4/CoOOH supported on 3D porous nickel foam was synthesized successfully via annealing and green hydrothermal strategies.

Sn auxiliary agent promoting dispersion of Pt atoms over CeO2 catalysts and DFT calculation,"© 2022Highly dispersed metal nanoparticles on support are closely related to improving catalytic activity and reducing catalyst cost. Improving the dispersibility of the active components during the preparation of the catalyst is necessary for an unavoidable catalyst sintering in catalytic process. As an important catalytic system in industrial processes, Pt/CeO2 suffers from the sintering problem, therefore, there is an urgent need to improve the redispersion ability of Pt. Our work found that reverse oxygen overflow from CeO2 crystal can facilitate Pt redispersion. More importantly, introduction of Sn into the Pt/CeO2 can reduce the required temperature for Pt redispersion. The dissociation and anchoring of Pt atoms were calculated by DFT, and the redispersion mechanism of Pt on CeO2 support was explained from the perspective of thermodynamics.

Efficient electrocatalysts with strong core-shell interaction for water splitting: The modulation of selectivity and activity,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Optimum of electrocatalysts plays a key role in the design and development of cost-effective and environmentally benign technologies for energy conversion and storage. In this work, we study two kinds of core-shell structured electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in acid and alkali electrolyte. The electrocatalyst of cobalt@cobalt phosphide nanoparticles is grown on carbon nanotubes (Co@CoP/CNT) and shows a current density of 10 mA cm−2 at an overpotential of 67 mV in acid and 125 mV in alkali, demonstrating the strong metal-metal phosphide interaction facilitating hydrogen reduction. However, the in situ formed cobalt@cobalt oxide (Co@Co3O4/CNT) electrocatalysts from the Co@CoP/CNT can retard both the HER and OER performances through the metal-metal oxide interaction. The underlying mechanisms of the activity and selectivity of the core-shell catalysts towards water splitting reactions is further unveiled by density functional theory (DFT) simulation. The different catalytic behaviors of the core-shell structured catalysts in HER and OER are attributed to the different interactions between the metallic cores, shells and the adsorbed intermediate species. This study not only promises a facile and general strategy to fabricate high performance electrocatalysts but also sheds new light on crucial design principles of catalyst materials for intermediate-selective electrocatalytic reactions.",Journal of Alloys and Compounds

Ordered Ag@Pd alloy supported on Ti4O7 by ascorbic acid-assisted galvanic replacement for efficient oxygen reduction,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Core-shell catalysts have been extensively researched in enhancing the activity of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) by modifying bimetallic electrons. However, the conventional methods for synthesizing core-shell structures are not appropriate for supported catalysts. Here, we present a strategy to support ordered Ag@Pd core-shell structures on the Ti4O7 surface by ascorbic acid-assisted galvanic replacement (GR). The addition of appropriate amounts of Pd precursors during GR plays a crucial role in the morphology and activity of the ordered Ag@Pd/Ti4O7. Ordered Ag@Pd/Ti4O7 exhibits a half-wave potential of 0.895 V and mass activity of 1.22 A mgPd-1 at 0.9 V, where the latter is approximately 13.7 times higher than that of 20% Pt/C. Excitingly, the zinc-air battery with an ordered Ag@Pd/Ti4O7 catalyst as the cathode shows a maximum power density of 174 mW cm-2. The ordered characteristics of the Ag@Pd alloy and its strong electron transfer with the corrosion-resistant Ti4O7 effectively inhibit the oxidation of Ag, thus improving the catalytic activity and stability. The ingenious combination of ascorbic acid with GR provides a feasible mechanism for the synthesis of ordered bimetallic core-shell structure on oxide surfaces.",Journal of Alloys and Compounds

Here, manganese (Mn) and oxygen (O) dual-doping strategy were taken for demonstrating that enhancing photocatalytic reduction could achieve simultaneous modulation of the reduction and adsorption parameters by optimizing the electronic configuration and hydrophilicity ability in MoS2. Benefiting from the Mn and O dual-doping collective effect, the developed Mn,O-MoS2 exhibited outstanding photocatalytic reduction and recovery performances of gold(I) from thiosulfate leaching solutions with reduction capacity of 1386.98 mg/g and the corresponding recovery of 92.50%.

In this paper, molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) was successfully intercalated between the layers of LDH by hydrothermal and co-precipitation method, which combined the electrical conductivity and electrocatalytic properties of the two materials. The overpotential of the synthesized CoFeCr-LDH-621 @MoS2 is only 230 mV/260 mV for OER/HER at the current density of 10 mA cm-2, and the Tafel slope is 40 mV decades-1/49 mV decades-1.

Effect of sodium dodecyl sulfate surfactant concentrations on the novel strontium copper oxide nanostructures for enriching hydrogen evolution reaction electrochemical activity in alkaline solution,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Nowadays, hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) has gained more attention than the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in water-splitting. The OER, which involves a four-electron process, is more complex whereas the HER, which involves a two-electron process, is more easy. Hydrogen is one of the promising and efficient energy carriers for renewable and sustainable energy yield. In this work, we have successfully prepared a low-cost electrocatalyst of strontium copper oxide (SCO) through a simple co-precipitation method, followed by an annealing process. The X-ray diffraction is consistent with an orthorhombic structure of SCO. The different modes of vibrations containing Cu, Sr, and O bonds were identified by using the Raman and Fourier transform infrared spectra. The scanning electron microscopy images confirmed that the introduction of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) surfactant allowed to control the size and morphology of the prepared material. Electrochemical measurements indicated that 2 wt% SDS-assisted SCO material exhibited excellent HER performance and high stability. It achieved 166 mV to deliver 10 mA/cm2 and attained the low 124 mV/dec Tafel slope value, indicating that hydrogen evolution reaction followed the Volmer–Heyrovsky mechanism. Compared to the pure and 1 wt% SDS-SCO, 2 wt% SDS-SCO material exhibited a high electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) of 19.3 cm2 and showed a low 0.33 Ω charge-transfer resistance, indicating the presence of supplementary active sites and enhanced electrical conductivity than the reference electrocatalysts.

A stabilization synthesis strategy for atomically dispersed metal-N4 electrocatalysts via aerogel confinement and ammonia pyrolyzing,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdCatalytically active metals that are atomically dispersed on supports exhibit the highest atom utilization and most cost-effective pathways for electrocatalyst design. However, the high-throughput scalable production of inexpensive, efficient, and durable atomically dispersed electrocatalysts remains challenging. Herein, a hierarchical porous carbon aerogel loaded with atomically dispersed metal-N4 (metal-N-C) was synthesized via the NH3 pyrolysis of a metal-doped polymer aerogel. This novel synthetic strategy requires the tailoring of various materials, such as metal sol, resorcinol formaldehyde sol, hydrogel, and metal-N-C. The synthetic applicability of this strategy was demonstrated via the facile synthesis of Co-N-C, Ni-N-C, and Fe-N-C. Notably, Fe-N-C exhibited a half-wave potential of approximately 0.933 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode and lost approximately 4 mV after 5000 cycles of accelerated aging test in a 0.1 mol/L KOH solution for the oxygen reduction reaction. In a solid-state zinc-air battery, Fe-N-C exhibited a maximum power density of 167 m W cm−2, an energy density of 956 W h Kg−1, and long-term stability over 120 h, which significantly exceeds that of commercial Pt/C. The high activity and durability of Fe-N-C is attributed to the double Fe-N4 active center, where the synergistic effect of the neighboring Fe-N4 promotes oxygen dissociation and produces less H2O2. The developed strategy provides an aerogel-based solution for fabricating inexpensive, efficient, and durable atomically dispersed electrocatalysts with potential for high-throughput scalable production and expands the understanding of the synthesis of atomically dispersed electrocatalysts.",Nano Energy

Platinum-free electrocatalysts for hydrogen oxidation reaction in alkaline media,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdThe renewed anion exchange membrane fuel cells (AEMFCs) are expected to minimize the cost constraints of fuel cells owing to the advantages of employing economic catalysts. However, high Pt dosage (almost ten times higher than that in acids) caused by the sluggish hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) kinetics in alkaline media hampers the development of AEMFCs. Developing alternative Pt-free electrocatalysts is desirable but is limited by the lack of mechanistic understanding and system-wide design guidance. Against this backdrop, this review starts with the alkaline HOR mechanisms about reaction pathways, hydrogen/hydroxyl binding energy theory, and theoretical interpretations on the low HOR kinetics in alkali. Next, recent advances in developing supports, cocatalysts, and active components for Pt-free HOR catalysts are summarized. The synergistic mechanism of supports and cocatalysts with active metals is for the first time systematically introduced. Finally, a brief perspective on the remaining challenges and future directions of Pt-free electrocatalysts for alkaline HOR is also outlined.",Nano Energy
"Electrochemical hydrogen production coupled with oxygen evolution, organic synthesis, and waste reforming","© 2022 Elsevier LtdH2 gas is considered to be an ideal green energy carrier that can replace fossil fuels to ameliorate the rapidly increasing global issues of energy crisis and environmental pollution. Water splitting driven by electricity generated from renewable energy sources has attracted immense attention for H2 production. The conventional mode of water electrolysis involves two coupled half-reactions: the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Numerous high-performance OER electrocatalysts have been developed to increase the efficiency of the cathodic HER. However, the OER exhibits slow kinetics and high overpotential values, generating the low-economic-value O2 gas which forms the highly damaging reactive oxygen species (ROS) and hazardous H2/O2 mixtures. Therefore, to improve the utility of the anodic reaction and reduce the cost and power implementation of hydrogen production, numerous kinetically and economically favorable oxidation reactions have been proposed to replace the OER as electron donors for integration with the HER. In such hybrid systems, the oxidative potential is used to synthesize valuable chemicals and decompose harmful pollutants. In this review, recent developments in the anodes of conventional and hybrid water splitting technologies have been systematically summarized. Additionally, various alternative anodic reactions and the corresponding 3D integrated electrocatalysts in alkaline media have been highlighted. The technical features, potential challenges, and future perspectives have been thoroughly discussed.

Electrocatalytic oxidation technology, with easy-to-operate and environmental friendliness, is expected to be applied to degrade ammonia–nitrogen. However, the key issues are the sluggish kinetics and high overpotential in ammonia oxidation reaction (AOR). In this work, a unique three-dimensional nanoflower-like structure electrode was constructed by Co, S co-doping NiCu for catalyzing AOR. This electrode provides a huge contact area in the active substance/electrolyte interface, greatly shortening the ion transport paths.

The generation of carbon/oxygen double defects in FeP/CoP-N-C enhanced by β particles for photic driving degradation of levofloxacin,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Carbon-based materials have been widely studied for their special electronic structure and excellent catalytic performance. In this work, polypyrrole carbon-based precursors were prepared by the polymerization of pyrrole and phytic acid with the high coordination ability of Fe and Co. Then, an FeP/CoP-N-C-X catalyst with a three-dimensional net][work structure was obtained by high-temperature calcination, which was used for the degradation of levofloxacin (LEV). The obtained results showed that FeP/CoP-N-C-700 could completely remove LEV within 40 min. XPS, Raman spectroscopy and EPR spectroscopy demonstrated the existence of a typical carbon/oxygen double-defect structure in FeP/CoP-N-C-700. XPS results shows that the percentage of oxygen defects in the O element of FeP/CoP-N-C-700 was 73.05 %. DFT calculation results shows that the d-band center of FeP/CoP-N-C-700 with carbon/oxygen double defect was −1.35 eV, while that of FeP/CoP-N-C-700 without carbon/oxygen double defect was −1.78 eV. These results indicates that the carbon/oxygen double defects could change the distribution of local electrons in FeP/CoP-N-C-700, which made it exhibit higher n-type conductivity and charge separation efficiency. After each five photocatalytic cycles, FeP/CoP-N-C-700 was treated by electron beam irradiation, and the removal rate of LEV increased from 81.2 % to 96.32 %. XPS, Raman spectroscopy and EPR spectroscopy demonstrate that carbon/oxygen double defects in FeP/CoP-N-C-700 can be regenerated by electron beam irradiation, which could greatly improve the service life of the catalyst. Furthermore, LC-MS results indicates that FeP/CoP-N-C-700 preferentially dissociates the piperazinyl group in levofloxacin and exhibits a single degradation pathway for it. This work not only provides a new idea for the regeneration of materials and the improvement of cycle performance, but also provides a new strategy for the application of electron beam irradiation in the field of photocatalysis.",Separation and Purification Technology

A novel one-step calcination tailored single-atom iron and nitrogen co-doped carbon material catalyst for the selective reduction of CO2 to CO,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Single atom Fe-N-C based electrocatalysts are the most promising candidates for industrial applications of reduction of CO2. However, preparation of Fe-N-C catalyst often involves complex procedures and expensive precursors/reagents. In this work, we developed a novel one-step calcination method to tailor single-atom Fe-N-C catalyst for CO2 reduction. The maximum Faraday efficiency of CO (FECO) and the Tafel slope of Fe-N-C material was 73% and 68 mv dec−1, respectively, which was much higher than that of the pristine N-C material. The CO2 electroreduction products were CO and H2 with a total Faraday efficiency of 100%, indicating that the Fe-N-C material had high selectivity on CO2 reduction to CO. The designed Fe-Nx structure on the Fe-N-C material acted as a highly active site, and the abundant functional groups and microporous structure resulted in high catalytic performance of Fe-N-C material. This work demonstrates that the tailored single-atom Fe-N-C catalyst by one-step calcination has broad application prospects in the electrochemical reduction of CO2.",Separation and Purification Technology
TiO1.8 with lattice H for effective electrocatalytic nitrogen fixation,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Titanium dioxide (TiO2) is widely used as a representative transition metal oxides (TMOs) catalyst for electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR). However, the low stability, low selectivity, low ammonia (NH3) yield and high overpotential of TiO2 towards NRR strongly restricted its application in NRR. Here, we firstly add H to the lattice to synthesize a black TiO2−x with oxygen vacancies (OVs) (B-TiO1.8) for electrocatalytic NRR. After we optimized the amount of H and OVs, the NH3 yield and stability can achieve 31.6 μg h−1 mgcat−1 and 100 h at − 0.1 V (vs. RHE), respectively, the faradaic efficiency (FE) can achieve 47.7% at 0 V (vs. RHE). In situ FTIR / ESR / XPS / TPD illustrate that OVs can promote the adsorption and activation of nitrogen (N2), and lattice H can increase the number of OVs and stabilize them, suppress the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and promote the hydrogenation of N2.",Applied Catalysis B: Environmental
Confining homogeneous Ni0.5Co0.5Se2 nanoparticles in Ti3C2Tx MXene architectures for enhanced sodium storage performance,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Transition metal selenides are regarded as potential sodium storage materials for their high theoretical capacity and superior electrical conductivity. However, unsatisfied cycle stability and rate capability, which is caused by its intrinsic structural instability and sluggish conversion reaction, greatly hinder the application. Herein, in-situ electrostatic attraction and selenization process are used to construct Ni0.5Co0.5Se2/Ti3C2Tx composite, in which the homogeneous Ni0.5Co0.5Se2 nanoparticles are anchored in the Ti3C2Tx MXene architecture. Based on the unique confinement effect and strong chemical interface coupling, the volume expansion and aggregation of the Ni0.5Co0.5Se2/Ti3C2Tx anode during the cycling process are effectively prevented. Furthermore, the evenly Ni0.5Co0.5Se2 bimetallic selenides nanoparticles endow rapid charge transfer and redox kinetics due to shortened Na+ diffusion distance and more accessible active sites. As a result, the as-prepared Ni0.5Co0.5Se2/Ti3C2Tx anode exhibits long cycle stability over 1000 cycles at 2.0 A g−1, pushing forward the construction of advanced conversion-type anode for high-performance sodium-ion batteries.",Applied Surface Science
Tuning the coordination environment of Fe atoms enables 3D porous Fe/N-doped carbons as bifunctional electrocatalyst for rechargeable zinc-air battery,"© 2022 Elsevier Inc.As one of the most promising candidates for power sources, the rechargeable Zn-air batteries have attracted much attention due to their high energy density. However, Zn-air batteries suffer from sluggish kinetics of oxygen reduction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) during the discharge and charge process. Herein, a FeN2-doped carbon with a unique three-dimensional (3D) porous structure (CeO2-FeNC-5) was synthesized as an electrocatalyst for Zn-air batteries by one-step pyrolysis and introducing CeO2 to tune the coordination environment of Fe atoms. Extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) results indicate that the introduction of CeO2 can convert FeN3 moieties into FeN2 moieties. The CeO2-FeNC-5 exhibits a more positive half-wave potential of 0.902 V for ORR, and a low overpotential of 0.327 V at 10 mA cm−2 for OER. Furthermore, the Zn-air battery with CeO2-FeNC-5 achieve a maximum power density (169 mW cm−2), a high open voltage platform (1.47 V) and superior cycling stability (200 h). The unique 3D porous structure provides channels for mass transport and exposes sufficient active sites to facilitate the ORR and OER processes. Calculations prove that FeN2 moieties are beneficial to O2 adsorption on Fe/N-doped carbon surface. This work provides an effective strategy for designing and synthesizing FeNx-doped carbon matrix electrocatalysts for sustainable metal-air batteries.",Journal of Colloid and Interface Science
"Photothermal functional material and structure for photothermal catalytic CO2 reduction: Recent advance, application and prospect","© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Photothermal catalytic CO2 reduction to solar fuels is one of the most promising technologies for industrial development. Photothermal catalytic CO2 reduction by H2 and CH4 have high fuel production rate and light-to-fuel efficiency, which become pioneer in the industrialization of solar fuels, while the yield of artificial photosynthesis still has a gap with industrialization, the low solar light absorption, photothermal conversion, active site exposure and carrier mobility severely restrict the development from laboratory to industrialization. Photothermal functional structures and materials have become a breakthrough due to excellent full solar spectrum absorption capacity, photothermal conversion properties, and excellent electrical conductivity. In order to bring inspiration to the breakthrough of the bottleneck, this paper reviewed the latest research progress of emerging photothermal functional materials (GDY, MXene, BP) and photothermal functional structures (bionic, nanoarrays, HoMSs) in photothermal catalytic CO2 reduction from the regulation mechanism of sunlight absorption, photothermal conversion, active site exposure and carrier migration, and further proposed the potential application value of photothermal functional materials and structures in photothermal catalytic CO2 reduction. Finally, a critical review of how all-weather photothermal catalytic CO2 reduction breaks through the barrier of darkness, carbon pollution and inhibition of high temperature inactivation under concentrating light, and critical insights into the development direction, research progress, cautions, and future development opportunities of photothermal catalytic CO2 reduction from laboratory to industrialization are presented.",Coordination Chemistry Reviews
Polyoxometalates-rich separator for fast polysulfide conversion kinetics and dense lithium deposition toward stable Li–S batteries,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Lithium−sulfur batteries have great potential in the field of next-generation energy-storage devices owing to their high theoretical energy density. However, the polysulfide intermediates shuttling seriously result in fast capacity degradation and poor cycling stability, thus hindering their commercial applications. In this paper, we choose polyvinylidene fluoride containing polar functional groups in its polymeric chain as polymer carrier to construct the H3PW12O40 firmly and uniformly decorated nanofibers membrane by electrospinning technique. Benefiting from the feature of “electron sponges”, H3PW12O40 can act as polysulfide mediator to significantly facilitate the liquid-liquid reaction kinetics of polysulfides in the electrode/separator interface. Besides, fewer cracks, pulverization and adhesion of dead lithium particles occurred in the lithium metal anode, demostrating a more homogeneous Li-ion flux distribution after using this membrane with three-dimensional network structure and abundant redox active sites. The cell with such bifunctional separator delivers a specific capacity of 966 mAh g−1 at 1.0 C, and retained a capacity of 682 mAh g−1 after 300 cycles, corresponding to an average capacity loss of 0.09% per cycle.",Journal of Alloys and Compounds
Investigate the role of V in the Nitrogen-doped hierarchical porous carbon-supported binary transition metal nitrides catalyst for oxygen reduction reactions,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.N-doped carbon-supported titanium nitride (TiN/NC) is considered promising for its application in Zn-air batteries. However, the performance of TiN/NC cannot meet the practical application. To solve this problem, the catalytic activity and stability of the catalyst can be improved by introducing the second metal element V. In this paper, a high-performance catalyst (TixV1−xN/NC/C) was prepared by supporting titanium-vanadium binary transition metal nitride nanoparticles on nitrogen-doped carbon. The experimental results and density functional theory (DFT) calculations confirm that the electronic, atomic and microstructure of titanium nitride nanoparticles can be properly tuned by introducing V ions, which is beneficial to tune the adsorption/adsorption of oxygen intermediates on titanium nitride nanoparticles and decreasing the potential of the rate determining step, thereby increasing the catalytic activity. The TixV1−xN/NC/C composite exhibits excellent ORR performance with an onset potential (Eonset) and limiting current density of 0.91 V (vs. RHE) and 4.90 mA∙cm−2, respectively. The Ti0.85V0.15N/NC/C-based Zn-air battery exhibits the power density of 124.78 mW·cm−2, open circuit voltage of 1.34 V and high specific capacity of 731.38 mAh·g−1.

"Two-dimensional metal-organic frameworks: From synthesis to biomedical, environmental, and energy conversion applications","© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Two-dimensional metal-organic frameworks (2D MOFs) are currently intelligent multifunctional nanostructure materials receiving accelerated attention for different applications in biomedical, environmental remediations, and energy conversion. This is due to their exceptional properties and advantages over conventional materials. They have appealing two-dimensionalities, crystallinity, connecting metal ions with organic linkers, ultrahigh surface areas, nanoscale structures, tunable cage/porous sizes, large surface-to-volume ratios, a larger number of active metal ion sites, flexible skeletons, proficiency in electron transports and transfer capability, and reasonable design strategies. Distinctly, the current study presents recent advances in the 2D MOFs for environmental remediations, energy conversion, and biomedical applications. It started with a comprehensive review of the synthesis strategies of the 2D materials, followed by the strategic modification approach for 2D MOFs for different applications. Unlike the available reviews in the field, the study includes detailed discussions in the biomedical (including biosensing, therapeutic delivery, bioimaging, biocatalysis, photodynamic therapy, biocompatibility, and toxicity), environmental remediations of pollutants (focusing on the various organic and inorganic pollutants remediations), and energy conversion (including nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR), oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR), overall water splitting, oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) with the corresponding performance of 2D MOFs in these fields, fundamental concepts and mechanisms. The new engineering strategic protocols for accelerating the performance of 2D MOF materials for various applications and some insights into future research discussed in the present study were absent in the available literature. To bridge the knowledge gaps, some associated weaknesses and strengths, and the treatment strategies of the past studies were discussed. In addition, some vital outlooks and recommendations for advancing the 2D MOFs and the corresponding applications in biomedical, environmental remediations of organic and inorganic pollutants, NRR, CO2RR, OER, ORR, HER, and overall water splitting toward realistic industrial expectations were discussed. This review will help the scientific community to understand the research hotspot and the necessity for the fabrication of more viable novel 2D MOFs for clean energy, environmental, and biomedical security in a more eco-friendly approach to alleviate greenhouse gas emissions, global energy shortage, biomedical and environmental insecurity challenges.",Coordination Chemistry Reviews
Recognition of water-dissociation effect toward lattice oxygen activation on single-atom Co catalyst in toluene oxidation,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.The presence of water can promote the catalytic activity of some heterogeneous catalysts by oxygen activation, but the mechanism remains unclear especially for transition metal single-atom catalysts (SACs), which is further complicated due to the difficult identification of active sites. In this study, we prepared single-atom Co supported on MnO2 and investigated the promotion mechanism of oxidation reaction with the existence of water. According to the results of various characteristic experiments and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, it was found that the single-atom Co forms the Co−O−Mn entity as the actual active site on Co1/MnO2 and the dissociation of water on the active site facilitates the activation of lattice oxygen of support, which are responsible for the activity promotion. The unique water effect of Co1/MnO2 was further confirmed by comparing the performance of CoOx-nanoparticles catalyst (CoOx/MnO2). This work provides new insight into the lattice oxygen activation mechanism of transition metal SACs.",Applied Catalysis B: Environmental
Efficient full spectrum responsive photocatalytic NO conversion at Bi2Ti2O7: Co-effect of plasmonic Bi and oxygen vacancies,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Developing full-spectrum responsive and efficient photocatalysts is still an important challenge in the field of photocatalytic treatment of trace environmental pollutants. Herein, full-spectrum Bi@Bi2Ti2O7 with rich-oxygen vacancies (OVs) were fabricated via a one-pot hydrothermal method. The optimized composite photocatalyst exhibited a photocatalytic efficiency of 79 %, more than doubled higher than that of its counterpart, Bi2Ti2O7 (31.79 %), for removing ppb-level NO under visible-near infrared (Vis-NIR) irradiation. The enhanced photocatalytic performance was attributed to the co-effect of Bi and OVs reveal by control experiments and theoretical calculations, which not only benefited the adsorption and photocatalytic activation of NO but broadened light absorption to near infrared region. Furthermore, the adsorption and photocatalytic conversion pathway of NO was explored by in situ DRIFTS, suggesting that NO+ as intermediate species is crucial to improve the selectivity of NO converting to nitrate. This work provides a new perspective of constructing full-spectrum-driven photocatalysts for environment remediation.",Applied Catalysis B: Environmental
Heterointerface-triggered electronic structure reformation: Pd/CuO nano-olives motivate nitrite electroreduction to ammonia,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Electrochemical nitrite reduction reaction (NO2−RR) to synthesize NH3 is a green and sustainable technology. Herein, we report porous-rich Pd/CuO nano-olives (Pd/CuO NOs) with heterointerfaces for efficient NO2−RR. The porous structure of Pd/CuO NOs provides abundant channels for molecular permeation and increases the accessible active sites between the reactant and the catalyst. More importantly, the Pd/CuO heterointerfaces spontaneously establish a built-in electric field in the interfacial region, which favorably adjusts the electronic structure of Pd and Cu sites and optimizes the adsorption of NO2− and reaction intermediates. Benefiting from structural advantages and interfacial engineering, the Pd/CuO NOs exhibit excellent NO2−RR performance (NH3 yield rate: 906.4 μg h−1 mg−1cat., NH3 Faradaic efficiency: 91.8%, NH3 selectivity: 94.9%) at − 1.5 V. This work provides a powerful route for fabricating porous-rich heterostructures with local charge polarization and provides a promising strategy for design of efficient catalysts for various electrocatalytic and electrosynthesis applications, beyond NO2−RR.",Applied Catalysis B: Environmental
Computational exploration of dual atom catalysts loaded on defective graphene for oxygen reduction reaction,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Single and paired atomic catalysts have attracted substantial interest due to their excellent catalytic activity toward oxygen reduction reactions (ORR). Herein, a group of dual metal catalysts with various transition metal (TM = Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Ru, and Pt) atoms supported on N-doped graphene with a four-atom vacancy (N8V4) were designed and screened for their ability to catalyze ORR. The density functional theory (DFT) method was employed to obtain theoretical overpotentials (η) to evaluate the performance of each catalyst in comparison with the benchmark catalyst, Pt/C (η = 0.45 V). The volcano plot of ΔG*OH versus onset potential was created. Our results showed that RuCo@N8V4, with paired Ru and Co atoms anchored in N8V4 pores, exhibited the best catalytic activity with an overpotential of 0.33 V on the top of volcano, followed by PtCo@N8V4 (0.38 V), ZnCo@N8V4 (0.41 V) and FeCo@N8V4 (0.43 V). Compared with a single Co atom catalyst Co@N8V4 (η = 0.72 V), it was found that the introduction of the second TM could significantly improve the catalytic performance. This is because the d-band center of the system shifts apart from Fermi energy level, reducing the adsorption of the OH intermediate. Moreover, the local polarization charges of Co and adsorption properties of O2 molecule are also improved by the nature of the second TM, hence enhancing the catalytic activity of the Co catalyst.",Applied Surface Science
A hierarchically porous TiN/N-C electrocatalyst with high interface utilization for lithium-sulfur batteries,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Lithium-Sulfur Batteries (LiSBs) are prevented to apply in practice by the irreversible loss from the cathode and difficult conversation kinetics of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs). An ideal S host material should possess high conductivity and sufficiently dispersed catalytic active sites to precisely restore the dissolved LiPSs to the surface of the S host material. In traditional catalyst design, porous carbonaceous materials are often selected as carriers for the nano-catalytic activity sites. However, non-polar pure carbon interfaces, where without nano-catalytic activity sites covered, have a very weak affinity to LiPSs. Here, we use ammonia as a nitrogen source to anneal the reduced aerogel (graphene oxide (rGO) supported nano-TiO2) at high temperatures. The N element is atomically doped into the lattice of the carbon matrix, and the nano-TiO2 is converted to nano-TiN. A hierarchically porous and high conductivity TiN/N-C is prepared, in which the nano-TiN is well dispersed on the surface of N-doped rGO as an active center for catalyzing LiPSs conversion. The doped-N elements significantly increase the proportion of the polar surface. The S@TiN/N-C composite cathode delivered an excellent long-life cycling performance, and the reversible discharge specific capacity faded from 1224 ± 16 to 675 ± 31 mAh g−1 after 930 cycles. More importantly, after 150 cycles with a high S loading, a reversible areal capacity of 4.1 mAh cm−2 can be achieved.",Applied Surface Science

Herein, we review recent progresses in the design, synthesis, and catalytic mechanisms of COF-based functional materials for CO2 utilization reactions such as photo/electrocatalytic CO2 reduction, cycloaddition, carboxylation, and hydrogenation. We thoroughly evaluate and discuss photocatalytic CO2 reduction reactions using pristine and metalated COFs; CO2 electroreduction and carboxylation reactions using different metal-based COFs; and CO2 cycloaddition reactions using non-metalated, metalated, and ionic liquid-functionalized COFs. Finally, the challenges and prospects of CO2 utilization using COF-based catalysts are highlighted.",Coordination Chemistry Reviews
Advanced MOF-derived carbon-based non-noble metal oxygen electrocatalyst for next-generation rechargeable Zn-air batteries,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Zn-air batteries (ZABs) are considered as one of the most prospective green electrochemical energy storage and conversion devices due to their low-cost, high-energy density, environment friendly and satisfactory safety. However, the performance of ZABs is largely limited according to the activity of oxygen electrocatalysts. Precious metal Pt-based catalysts are often used together with Ru- or Ir-based catalysts for rechargeable ZABs. However, the high price and scarce resources limit their commercialized production. Metal-organic framework (MOF) materials have been considered as a valuable candidate for cathode material of ZAB due to their suitable price, unique porous crystal structure and adjustable chemical characteristics. However, the poor electrical conductivity and insufficient chemical stability severely limit their applications in electrocatalysis. In this work, the recent development of MOF-derived carbon-based non-noble metal carbon materials as cathode catalysts for rechargeable ZABs including morphology design, chemical composition and electrochemical performance is reviewed. The catalytic mechanism of MOF-based non-noble metal carbon materials is systematically summarized, and the main points determining the electrochemical performance of MOF-derived carbon-based non-noble metal electrocatalysts are discussed in detail. Promising strategies for improving bifunctional catalytic activity are then highlighted.

An all-organic spatial structure composed of perylene diimide/mesoporous graphitic carbon nitride for high efficiency photocatalysis,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.The development of semiconductor photocatalytic technology is still limited to low carrier separation efficiency and secondary contamination of metal ions. The construction of bandgap-matched all-organic semiconductor materials is environmentally friendly and can achieve directional carrier migration and efficient separation. Herein, a series of perylene diimide/mesoporous graphitic carbon nitride (PDI/mpg-C3N4) all-organic composites with spatial stereostructure were successfully fabricated via in-situ electrostatic assembly. The spatial structure composed of perylene diimide/mesoporous graphitic carbon nitride exhibit outstanding light absorption properties and rapid separation and migration abilities of photocarriers, which greatly enhance solar energy utilization. The experiment results exhibit that the bisphenol A (BPA) degradation rate of the 20% perylene diimide/mesoporous graphitic carbon nitride (20% PDI/mpg-C3N4) composite attained to 3.4 and 7.3 times than that of the self-assembled perylene diimide (self-assembled PDI) and mesoporous graphitic carbon nitride (mpg-C3N4).

In this review, we will highlight selected stoichiometric or catalytic reactions driven by substituted ethylenes and dithiolenes, as well as six-membered ligands, such as catecholato, benezendithiolato, aminophenolato, and o-phenelyenediamine derivatives. Chemically, electrochemically, and photochemically induced lability of these ligands can be expected to provide an enriched recipe for a platform toward useful bond-activation and bond-formation processes.",Coordination Chemistry Reviews
Bilateral gradient defect engineering integrated atomic in-layer homojunctions for efficient photoelectrochemical water splitting,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Severe recombination of photo-generated carriers restricts the application of photoelectrochemical water splitting. Designing carrier spatial separation paths at the atomic level is an innovative but challenging strategy to address this problem. Herein, we first propose a gradient defect model confined in atomic layers. Bilateral gradient Cd doping terminated at the outer surfaces of five-atomic-layer BiOI nanosheets was achieved by a linear pressurized gas-assisted (LPGA) technique with self-adapting oxygen vacancies generated unexpectedly. Different doping concentrations between layers trigger the rearrangement of energy levels, resulting in distributed atomic homojunctions with “pyramid-like” band alignment to synergistic modulate carrier separation. Thus, the gradient Cd doping BiOI displays a charge separation efficiency of 78.1%, which is 12.0 and 7.9 times higher than those for pristine BiOI and uniform doping BiOI. Furthermore, the record photocurrent density of 4.68 mA cm−2 at 0 VRHE is the highest absolute value of BiOI photocathodes reported to date and outperforms most bismuth-based photocathodes. Our work provides a new method to modulate photo-generated carrier separation at the atomic level and deepens the understanding of homojunction semiconductors.",Applied Surface Science
Transition metal embedded graphynes as advanced bifunctional single atom catalysts for oxygen reduction and evolution reactions,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Noble metals are well-known to be highly efficient for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). However, their scarcity and high price have severely hampered their large-scale commercial applications. In this work, with the aid of density functional theory calculations we systematically screened 26 types of transition metal atom embedded γ-graphyne monolayer (TM-GY) as potential effective and cheap single functional and bifunctional single-atom catalysts (SACs) for ORR/OER. The catalytic activity of ORR/OER can be expressed by a single descriptor of the adsorption free energy of the OH intermediate. Our research shows that Fe, Ir, Co, Rh, Cu, Ni, Pd and Pt-GY are potential single-functional and bifunctional SACs candidates for ORR or/and OER. Specifically, Co-GY was found to be the optimal bifunctional SAC for ORR and OER. A three-step strategy for screening bifunctional SACs was put forward: (i) non-radioactive/toxic element, (ii) single-function SACs and (iii) bifunctional SACs.",Applied Surface Science
"TMB2C (TM = Ti, V): 2D transition metal borocarbide monolayer with intriguing electronic, magnetic and electrochemical properties","© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Designing two-dimensional materials with intriguing electronic and magnetic properties holds great potential for electronic and spintronic device application. By means of density functional theory calculations, we predicted a class of 2D MXene-like transition metal (TM) borides, TMB2C (TM = Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe) monolayer and their TMB2CX analogues by terminating various functional groups (X = H, O, F, S). The results show that two TMB2C monolayers at TM = V and Cr are thermodynamically stable with lager cohesive energies and positive frequencies in the phonon dispersion bands. TiB2C is antiferromagnetic (AFM) semiconductor and VB2C is ferromagnetic (FM) half metal with a high Curie temperature (Tc) of ∼ 580 K. Moreover, TiB2CXs and VB2CXs (X = H, O, F, S) show better mechanical stability and distinct electronic and magnetic properties with semiconductor-(half) metal and FM-AFM transform. Interestingly, VB2CF is revealed to exhibit excellent hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance with an adsorption Gibbs free energy for H atom close to zero (ΔGH* = 0.03 eV). The high stability and excellent properties make TMB2C(X) monolayer a promising candidate for potential spintronic and electrocatalytic application.",Applied Surface Science
Rational design of the first and second coordination spheres for copper single-atom catalyst to boost highly efficient oxygen reduction,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Copper is an essential nutrient for all living things and as the component of more than 30 enzymes in the human body for the development of connective tissue, nerve coverings. However, carbon materials doped with nitrogen and transition metal singlet (M[sbnd]N[sbnd]C) with CuN4 site as reaction center usually exhibit unsatisfactory oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity, due to poor O2 adsorption and activation. In this work, density functional theory (DFT) was used to explore the effect of introducing heteroatoms such as B, N, P, and S into the first and second coordination spheres to improve the ORR catalytic activity for Cu[sbnd]N[sbnd]C. Through the study of 41 model systems, we predicted CuN3 (ηORR = 0.32 V), CuN4P (II) (ηORR = 0.49 V) and CuN4S2(II) (ηORR = 0.37 V) fragments would have good ORR catalytic activity. This is due to the increased charge and tailored d-band fine structure, optimizing the reaction intermediate binding strength. These findings indicate the influence of the ligand field (formed by the anion in the first and second coordination spheres) on the catalytic activity and provide a new direction for the synthesis of high-efficiency electrocatalyst materials.",Applied Surface Science
Ni3+-enriched nickel-based electrocatalysts for superior electrocatalytic water oxidation,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.A good understanding of the strategy to improve the reconstruction process and catalytic mechanism of non-noble transition metal electrocatalysts in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is crucial to achieving high-efficiency and energy-saving hydrogen production because it is considered the rate-determining step in water splitting. In this work, Fe-doped NiO nanosheet arrays are prepared on carbon cloth (Fe/NiO/CC) by a simple solution method and subsequent sonication. The Fe dopants facilitate energy-efficient and rapid surface reconstruction, activate more Ni3+ species, and generate more oxygen vacancies to enable fast and efficient OER. As a result, an overpotential of merely 288 mV is required for a current density of 100 mA cm−2 by the Fe/NiO/CC electrocatalyst and a small Tafel slope of 72.6 mV dec−1 is observed in the alkaline electrolyte. Based on density-functional theory calculation, the difference in the bonding and charge redistribution in NiO caused by Fe dopants modulates the electronic structure and coordination unequally, consequently increasing the number of active sites and enhancing the intrinsic catalytic activity as well. The results provide a deeper understanding of how heteroatom doping modulates the intrinsic activity of active atoms in transition metal-based electrocatalysts and reveal the role in reconstruction in electrocatalytic OER.",Applied Surface Science
Rational design synergistic metal-free dual-atom electrocatalyst for N2 to NH3 reaction on g-CN: A first principle study,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.The electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) for ammonia production is promising for N2 fixation under ambient conditions. Most of the previous studies focus on transition metal-based catalysts, while the metal-free-based ones have not gotten enough attention. We designed dual-site metal-free atoms anchored on g-CN for electrocatalytic NRR based on the density functional theory (DFT) calculation. Results indicated that the B and P atoms co-doped g-CN system exhibits excellent NRR performance with a low limiting potential of −0.18 V, superior to most metal-based catalysts. In addition, a synergistic effect induced by the hybridization of B and P atoms is proposed. Eventually, the selectivity, thermodynamical stability, and conductivity are investigated. All of these modulations make the B-P@g-CN an excellent electrocatalyst.

High activity, NH4+–N selectivity and long-term stability of a cathode are essential for the application. Herein, we reported a sulfur-modified Fe foam (FeSx @FF) cathode, which achieved high NO3−–N conversion (94.96%) and NH4+–N selectivity (82.29%) due to its enhanced electron transfer, atomic hydrogen (H*) generation, and adsorption of NO3−. Combined in-situ differential electrochemical mass spectrometry and theoretical calculations reveal that the ultrafast *NO3 reduction to *NO2 and low formation energy of *NO are crucial in reduction of *NO3 to *NH3. The FeS0.2 @FF cathode for realistic industrial wastewater (∼350 mg L−1 NO3−–N) treatment shows high TN removal (90.75%) and N2 selectivity (98.88%) with an ultralow electrical cost (∼0.22 kWh g−1N).

Notable crystalline distortion was induced by manganese insertion into Co3O4 lattice, resulting in smaller crystallite size, more abundant Co2+ and considerable oxygen vacancies. All these properties were regarded as the crucial origins for electrocatalytic activity elevation. The catalyst annealed at 450 °C (denoted as Mn/Co-450) exhibited the optimal catalytic activity with an ultra-low potential gap (0.83 V). Using Mn/Co-450 as an air cathode, the zinc-air battery delivered high power density (115.5 mW cm−2), competitive specific capacity (783.4 mAh g−1) and good cycling stability. The theoretical overpotentials of ORR and OER were respectively decreased by 0.18 V and 0.05 V by DFT calculation due to the weakened interaction between Co and OH group and the strengthened Co-OOH interaction.",Applied Catalysis B: Environmental
Bridge-linking interfacial engineering of triple carbons for highly efficient and binder-free electrodes toward flexible Zn-air batteries,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Reasonable modulation of catalyst/substrate interface still remains great challenge for binder-free and high-performance electrodes. Herein, interfacial engineering via bridge-linking is proposed to effectively integrate powdery catalysts with flexible substrates by in situ synthesized nanocarbon. Concretely, a binder-free CNTs on carbonized carbon cloth linked with N-doped nanocarbons (CNTs-NC-CCC) electrode is formed via self-assembly and covalent coupling. Experimental results and theoretical calculation disclose that the bridge-linking strategy not only enables the fast electron and mass transfer, but also modifies the charge distribution and optimizes the adsorption/desorption process of oxygenated intermediates. With these merits, this metal-free catalyst exhibits superb bifunctional ORR/OER electrocatalytic activity with a voltage gap of 0.78 V. Remarkably, when equipped in aqueous and flexible Zn-air batteries, high power density (288, 68 mW cm–2) and enhanced durability are obtained. This facile nanocarbon-linkage strategy opens up a new avenue for the application of powdery catalysts in wearable energy devices.",Applied Catalysis B: Environmental
Tuning the band (p and d) center and enhancing the active sites by nitrogen(N) doping on iridium diphosphide (IrP2) for accelerating pH-universal water electrolysis,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Efficient water electrolysis requires highly active electrocatalysts with Pt/RuO2-like performance, which remain challenging to synthesize. To develop an ideal universal-pH catalyst, we fabricated N-doped noble metal iridium diphosphide (N-IrP2 @CC) catalyst via three-step synthesis on a carbon cloth substrate. The catalyst showed considerably higher catalytic activity compared with existing transition metal phosphide catalysts due to the P-rich condition and N dopants, achieving an overall water-splitting current density of 100 mA cm−2 at low operation voltages of 1.56 V and 1.64 V in 0.5 M H2SO4 and 1 M KOH, respectively. Density functional theory calculations showed that the N dopant can alter not only the band (d and p) center of Ir and P, but also the charge distribution of the IrP2 surface. Thus, a highly efficient and robust catalyst was developed for commercial water electrolysis.",Applied Catalysis B: Environmental
Critical roles of H2O and O2 in H2O2 photoproduction over biomass derived metal-free catalyst,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.In this paper, in-situ transient photoinduced-voltage combined with the continuous wavelet transform was used for the first time to study the critical roles of H2O and O2 in the H2O2 photoproduction. A metal-free photocatalyst containing carbon dots was synthesized by a one-step hydrothermal method using hesperidin as raw material. The photocatalytic H2O2 yield of the catalyst can reach 4480 μmol·L−1 under visible light without sacrificial agent. In addition to being raw materials, we have proved that H2O and O2 can regulate the photogenerated electron transport kinetics, namely, O2 can decelerate low-frequency electron transport, while H2O can accelerate the low-frequency electron transport. This work provides an in-depth understanding on photocatalytic production of H2O2 over composite metal-free photocatalysts and new insight for their design.",Applied Catalysis B: Environmental
"Microtubular electrodes: An emerging electrode configuration for electrocatalysis, bioelectrochemical and water treatment applications","© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Electrochemical processes have attracted much attention as they can be empowered by renewable electricity for zero-emission processes under ambient conditions. Applications of electrochemistry in various areas such as electrocatalysis (e.g., water electrolysis, CO2 reduction), (waste)water treatment, fuel cells, and microbial processes have been recently emerging. Electrode design is a crucial feature in electrochemical systems. In some applications, porous electrodes are required to maximize the reaction sites and participate in reactants delivery, such as gas-diffusion electrodes (GDEs) for gas-phase electrolysis or membrane electrodes for water treatment. Planar shape porous electrodes are the conventional configuration with some drawbacks; for example, planar GDEs are made in multiple layers and are relatively complex to manufacture on large scales. Recently, microtubular (or hollow fiber) shape electrodes have been introduced as an alternative due to several advantages such as a higher active surface area to the volume ratio, small electrolyzer footprint, ease of processability, etc. This review presents a critical overview of the design and fabrication of microtubular electrodes and the structure-performance relationship. After that, the recent advances of microtubular electrodes in three main categories, including gas-phase electrocatalysis, (waste)water treatment, and bioelectrochemical systems, are discussed, with more focus on gas electrolysis wherein microtubular electrodes act as GDEs. GDEs for gas electrocatalysis are of great significance as they effectively boost reaction rate by continuously delivering reactant feeds to the reaction sites, resolving the issue of mass transport resistance, and microtubular GDEs can address several issues of planar GDEs. In the last section, future research opportunities are suggested to showcase the promises of microtubular electrodes as a versatile electrode configuration for electrochemical applications.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Ferric ions leached from Fe-based catalyst to trigger the dynamic surface reconstruction of nickel foam for high-efficient OER activity,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.The understanding of the interactions between catalyst and support is very important in heterogeneous catalysis of water splitting; however, it is still lacking. Herein, a Fe-based material of rod-like Fe2OF4 is fabricated as the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalyst. Strikingly, Fe2OF4 loaded on nickel foam support can exhibit high-efficient OER activity with low overpotential and Tafel slope. Furthermore, we reveal that partial ferric ions within Fe2OF4 can leach out into electrolyte; and then the ferric ions are electrochemically adsorbed on the surface of nickel foam, triggering dynamic surface reconstruction to generate highly active FeNi-oxyhydroxides under alkaline OER condition. Further, based on our findings, a promising approach is successfully proposed to prepare a large-size, low-cost and high-performance OER electrode via surface reconstruction on NF with ferric ions, showing remarkable performance. This work provides new insights into catalyst-support interactions, and proposes a straightforward surface reconstruction strategy for the scaling-up of electrocatalysts.",Applied Catalysis B: Environmental
Construction dual-regulated NiCo2S4 @Mo-doped CoFe-LDH for oxygen evolution reaction at large current density,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Developing efficient and nonprecious large-current-density based oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts is strongly required for sustainable industrial water splitting. Hence, a unique heterostructure erecting by Mo-doped CoFe layered double hydroxides coating NiCo2S4 nanotube arrays grown on nickel foam (NCS@CFM-LDH/NF) is elaborately demonstrated. It only needs an overpotential of 295/332 mV to achieve current density of 500/1000 mA cm−2, respectively, with a low Tafel slope of 83.0 mV dec−1 in alkaline media. NCS@CFM-LDH/NF also shows an ultra-long-term stability at 1000 mA cm−2 over 100 h. Its remarkable performance is ascribed to the synergic effect of multi-component and hierarchical structure. Additionally, Theoretical calculations disclose that the doping of molybdenum is beneficial to the adsorption of the *O intermediate, thus promotes OER activity. This study provides an attractive approach to design highly active and durable OER catalysts for industrial application in electrolysis of water.",Applied Catalysis B: Environmental
Post incorporation of Fe sites on defective carbon sponge with high accessibility to enhance oxygen reduction elecrocatalysis,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Monodispersed Fe-N/C single-atom catalysts have excellent oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity in renewable energy applications. Improving the availability and stability of iron monatomic catalytic sites is challenging. Herein, an iron phthalocyanine (FePc)-based vapor deposition strategy was designed for the synthesis of monodispersed Fe-N/C single-atom catalysts. The construction of Fe-N sites with both stability and high activity on defection-rich carbon surface has been realized, ascribed to the well balance between the evaporation and decomposition of FePc on defective carbon sponge (DCS) to generate enough Fe-N active sites with full accessibility. As a result, the optimized catalyst delivered excellent ORR activity, selectivity and stability, as well promising zinc-air battery performance with good power density and discharging stability.

Single-site Co-anchored α- In2Se3 with enhanced and polarization-dependent hydrogen and oxygen evolution activity,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Electroreduction of water into hydrogen holds promise to deal with growing environmental pollution and energy crisis, but it relies on efficient catalysts for both hydrogen/oxygen evolution reaction, that normally contain precious metal. Here, based on first principles calculations, we identify Co-anchored α-In2Se3 as a bifunctional catalyst that can operate for both hydrogen/oxygen evolution reaction. The chemical activity can be largely enhanced or optimized by electrostatic potential due to the polarization, even better than traditional one containing precious metal. Both hydrogen/oxygen evolution reaction are dependent on polarization direction of α-In2Se3 and could occur on different polarization domains separately of α-In2Se3, that providing a way for future design of bifunctional catalysts without precious metals based on two-dimensional ferroelectric substrate.",Journal of Alloys and Compounds
Synergy of physical and chemical constraints for stable lithium-sulfur batteries,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Lithium-sulfur battery is an appealing battery system, but it also suffers from the shuttle effect of lithium polysulfide (LiPS) and an unstable cycling life. Physical constraints to polysulfide via coating and chemical constraints from Lewis Acid-Based catalysis are considered as two promising solutions to achieve improvements. Herein, we design a porous polypyrrole-coated cobalt-rich bimetallic oxide (CoFe2O4 @PPy) via a simple method. It endows the cathode with abundant pore structure and adsorption/catalytic sites (N/O and Fe/Co), which can alleviate the polysulfide shuttle phenomenon and protect from sulfur lost. Because of an important synergy between physical and chemical constraints applied to LiPS, CoFe2O4 @PPy/S composite cathode shows excellent performance with a low capacity decay rate of 0.035 % per cycle after 300 cycles at 1 C.",Journal of Alloys and Compounds
Identifying the role of oxygen vacancy on cobalt-based perovskites towards peroxymonosulfate activation for efficient iohexol degradation,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Oxygen vacancy (VO) is attracting extensive interest in heterogeneous peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation, but its role remains elusive for water treatment. Herein, we constructed VO-tuned cobalt-based perovskite LaCoO3-VO, achieving superior activity (0.335 min−1) than LaCoO3 (0.124 min−1) for iohexol degradation. Nevertheless, VO did not directly serve as reactive sites, indicated by prohibited contaminant degradation via targeted poisoning of cobalt sites. Systemic electrochemical and spectroscopic measurements illustrate facile transformation of cobalt ions, increased charge density of depletion layer and low transfer resistance are attributed to VO manipulation. DFT calculations suggest reactant HSO5− is prone to attach defect site for elongated O-O bond. Experimental and theoretical results reveal the contributions of VO include adjusting PMS adsorption configuration, weakening lattice restraining of cobalt ions, reducing reaction barrier and optimizing electronic structures on perovskites. Our work attempts to understand energetic and kinetic factors of deficiency strategy for rational PMS-based degradation.",Applied Catalysis B: Environmental
Boosting electrochemical nitrogen reduction performance through water-in-salt electrolyte,"© 2022While electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) stands as a promising technique for sustainable NH3 fabrication due to its mild operation conditions, it has long been suffered from low efficiency and poor selectivity owing to the inertness of N2 and competition hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, we report the use of oxygen vacancy rich TiO2 loaded with Au nanoparticles as NRR catalyst in super concentrated lithium bis(trifluoromethane sulfonyl) imide (Li TFSI) “water-in-salt” system (20 M electrolyte) and obtain the Faradaic efficiency of 37.2 % with an NH3 yield rate of 20.3 μg h−1 cm−2 at − 0.4 V vs RHE, accompanied by the significant decay of both current density and onset potential of hydrogen evolution reaction. Electrochemical experimental and theoretical calculation results indicate that the HER process can be greatly hindered both kinetically and energetically. The unique effect of this “water-in-salt” electrolyte would offer a new idea to improve the NRR selectivity via HER suppression.",Applied Catalysis B: Environmental
Co single atoms and Co nanoparticle relay electrocatalyst for rechargeable zinc air batteries,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.The commercialization of rechargeable zinc air batteries (ZABs) requires the discovery of high-performance, low-cost and durable bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts. In this work, we report nitrogen doped carbon nano/microtubes confined metallic cobalt nanoparticles and single atoms (Co@NCNT/Co-SA@NCMT) as robust oxygen electrocatalyst for rechargeable ZABs. Co@NCNT/Co-SA@NCMT exhibits 18 times better ORR performance than Co@NCNT ascribed to the relay catalysis by Co-SAs and Co-NPs via O2→H2O2→H2O pathway. Experimental and theoretical investigations reveal that Co-SAs are capable of efficient oxygen reduction to H2O2, which is further reduced to H2O by Co-NPs due to its higher oxophilicity. Besides, due to the formed microtubes, the overpotential at 100 mA cm−2 in OER catalysis is lowered by 130 mV for Co@NCNT/Co-SA@NCMT than Co@NCNT. The power density of the assembled rechargeable ZAB is 155 mW cm−2 for Co@NCNT/Co-SA@NCMT outperforming the noble-metal counterpart (Pt/CB-IrO2: 71 mW cm−2). Furthermore, a superior stability with inappreciable increment in voltage gap for 300 h is achieved. Co@NCNT/Co-SA@NCMT also performs its high potential in the practical application with a maximum battery performance of 120 mW cm−2 sustained for 17 h in all-solid-state ZABs test.",Applied Catalysis B: Environmental
Perovskite oxide LaCr0.25Fe0.25Co0.5O3-δ as an efficient non-noble cathode for direct ammonia fuel cells,"© 2022 The AuthorsLaCoO3-δ (LCO) based perovskites including LaCr0.5Co0.5O3-δ (LCCO), LaFe0.5Co0.5O3-δ (LFCO) and LaCr0.25Fe0.25Co0.5O3-δ (LCFCO) were prepared and their oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity was studied. The presence of both Cr and Fe played vital roles in enhancing activity, affecting structural and electronic properties respectively. Cr doping was associated with surface oxygen vacancy formation whilst Fe doping enhanced the onset and half-wave potential. Furthermore, the effects of calcinating temperatures were explored and LCFCO fired at 700 oC (LCFCO-700) gave superior activity. Remarkably, when LCFCO-700 was employed in a direct ammonia fuel cell (DAFC), an OCV of 0.72 V and a maximum current density of ∼320 mAcm-2 was achieved when using air as the oxidant. Under similar conditions, DAFCs with LaCr0.25Fe0.25Co0.5O3-δ/C cathode, show comparable performance to the DAFC using Pt/C cathode, indicating that perovskite oxides, such as LaCr0.25Fe0.25Co0.5O3-δ, are promising non-noble cathodes for DAFCs.",Applied Catalysis B: Environmental
Large-scale synthesis of high loading Co single-atom catalyst with efficient oxidase-like activity for the colorimetric detection of acid phosphatase,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Single-atom catalysts (SACs) have shown broad application prospects in different area due to their maximum atomic utilization and excellent catalytic properties. However, how to realize large-scale synthesis of high loading SACs is still a problem for various application requirements. Herein, we report a novel strategy to synthesize Co single-atom catalyst (Co-SAC) by controllable releasing of Co atoms at high temperature, which can be effective to avoid the formation of Co nanoparticles. Particularly, the synthesized Co-SAC with Co content of 7.04 wt% contained exclusive single Co atoms coordinated Co-N4 active sites, demonstrated by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). The obtained Co-SAC exhibited excellent intrinsic oxidase-like activity by catalyzing the dissolved oxygen to superoxide radicals. Based on the antioxidant of ascorbic acid (AA) and the enzymatic property of acid phosphatase (ACP), a colorimetric assay for AA and ACP was established by utilizing the oxidase-like activity of Co-SAC. The results indicated that the limit of detection (LOD) of AA and ACP was 1.31 μM and 0.08 U/L, respectively. Considering the large-scale synthetic method and its excellent catalytic property, this kind of Co-SAC would have a good prospect in biosensor fields.",Applied Surface Science
Highly efficient and durable electrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction based on composition/shape controlled CuTi@Pt core-shell nanotubes in acidic media,"© 2022High-quality electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reactions, which have long-term stability and high efficiency, are a major challenge. Enhancing electrocatalytic efficiency can be achieved by creating alloys, designing core–shell structures, and controlling shapes. Herein, we demonstrate an elevated performance CuTi@Pt alloy catalyst with a one-dimensional nanotube structure through a galvanic replacement reaction. While the Pt/Cu atomic ratio and the wall thickness of the nanotube are carefully tuned, the CuTi@Pt alloy phase and tube structure are consequentially controlled. A systematic investigation is then conducted into the differences in composition and shape that impact the activity and durability. The optimized CuTi@Pt nanotube catalyst shows significant enhancements in the HER activity (1.12-fold decrease in Tafel compared to the commercial Pt/C) and the durability (remains unchanged after 24 h).",Applied Surface Science
Theoretical insights into multi-metal atoms embedded nitrogen-doped graphene as efficient bifunctional catalysts for oxygen reduction and evolution reactions,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.The development of high activity bifunctional electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is of great significance in renewable energy conversion and storage. In our study, density functional theory (DFT) is used to explore electrocatalytic mechanisms of dual-metal and tri-metal atoms anchored on graphene monolayer coordinated with pyridine nitrogen atoms. The stability of dual-metal and tri-metal sites is evaluated, and the charge redistribution of doped structures is quantitatively studied through Bader charge analysis. Furthermore, several N-doped graphene configurations with excellent bifunctional activities are screened based on the overpotentials in ORR and OER processes. More importantly, the volcano plots are constructed using appropriate ORR and OER descriptors to analyze and predict catalytic activities of metal/nitrogen co-doped graphene with different configurations. Among them, NiNiCoN9-G has superior bifunctional activities, and the most suitable metal and nitrogen doping association can be predicted. These findings will provide insights into the structure–activity relationship and catalytic mechanisms of doped graphene and offer guidelines for future designs of OER/ORR bifunctional electrocatalysts.",Applied Surface Science
Regulating Ru-based double perovskite against lattice oxygen oxidation by incorporating Ir for efficient and stable acidic oxygen evolution reaction,"© 2022Oxygen evolution reaction is one of the core half-reactions in proton-exchange membrane (PEM) water electrolysis, but its slow reaction kinetics has been limiting the overall energy conversion efficiency (e.g., water splitting). It is urgent to develop efficient catalysts for OER in acidic media. At present, Ru-based catalysts have high activity, but their poor stability makes them difficult to be used in acidic oxygen evolution reactions. The involvement of lattice oxygen mechanism (LOM) in the reaction is one of the main causes of instability in Ru-based catalysts. Herein, we synthesized SrRu0.5Ir0.5O3 double perovskite by doping Ir into SrRuO3. The double perovskite displays an extraordinary OER performance with a low overpotential of 185 mV at 10 mA cm−2 current density and maintains its catalytic stability for over 50 h in 0.5 M H2SO4. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy results show that the electronic synergistic effect between Ir and Ru enables the double perovskite materials with high activity. Meanwhile, the double perovskite catalyst inhibits the occurrence of the lattice oxygen mechanism during the OER, which greatly improve the catalytic stability of Ru-based perovskite materials.",Applied Surface Science

However, it is still very challenging to identify the contributions from the two effects on activity enhancement, which restrains the rational design of Pd-based alloy electrocatalysts. Herein, we reported the synthesis of PdMn nanosheet assembled nanobuds using a facile polymeric surfactant-free method with eliminated strain effect essentially, which were demonstrated as advanced catalysts in the aspect of much better catalytic activity and stability compared with the-state-of-the-art Pd-C catalyst. The catalytic enhancement mechanism should be attributed to the generated ligand effect which originates from the modulated electronic structure and consequent charge redistribution.",Applied Surface Science
(1 1 0) Facet of pentlandite with Fe-Ni heterostructure for promising electrocatalytic water splitting,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Developing stable, low cost, and efficient HER/OER bifunctional electrocatalysts is highly desired in overall water splitting. The bimetallic Fe-Ni-based systems can exhibit a great potential for overall water splitting. However, its electrocatalytic mechanism remain elusive as a bifunctional catalyst. Herein, in acidic medium, HER and OER mechanisms on the (1 1 0) facet of pentlandite are systematically investigated by means of density functional theory. The results unravel that the bimetallic Fe-Ni heterostructure can delicately regulate the charge transfer to accommodate themselves separately to oxidation and reduction. The Fe site exhibits the excellent catalytic HER activity while the Ni site shows the high catalytic OER activity. Interestingly, during the OER process, the Fe site with *OH-poisonous adsorption can further optimize catalytic performance of its adjacent Ni site. These studies provide an in-depth understanding in the synergistic effect of Fe-Ni toward rational design and fabrication of efficient water splitting electrocatalysts.",Applied Surface Science

Moreover, sustainable energies can power the two-electrode setup with amounts of hydrogen generation. The strategy may be particularly beneficial to explore simple synthesis and high-performance catalysts for HER.",Journal of Colloid and Interface Science
Optimizing the electronic structure of NiSe2/CoSe2 nanosheet arrays by phosphorus doping for high-efficiency oxygen evolution electrocatalysts,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Transition metal selenides with pyrite cubic phase structure have attracted much attention in the field of electrochemistry, for their low resistivity properties (<10−3 Ω cm) of Pauli paramagnetic metals. In view of the multi-step catalytic reaction in electrocatalytic oxygen evolution, NiSe2 and CoSe2 with the same crystallographic space group are selected to construct NiSe2/CoSe2 nanosheet arrays on carbon cloth by a facile layered double hydroxides (LDHs) selenization derived method. Moreover, the effect of phosphorus doping on electronic structure and electrocatalytic activity of NiSe2/CoSe2 is also investigated. When the mole ratio of phosphorus to selenium is 10%, the prepared phosphorus-doped NiSe2/CoSe2 nanosheet arrays (10%P-NiSe2/CoSe2) show superior oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance in alkaline media. It exhibits a small overpotential of 287 mV to realize a current density of 50 mA cm−2 and a low Tafel slope of 68 mv dec−1 in 1 M KOH solution. Furthermore, the cyclic stability test displays that the current density of 10%P-NiSe2/CoSe2 only decreases from 30.0 to 26.5 mA cm−2, after 12 h of continuous water oxidation reaction at 270 mV overpotential. The excellent OER activity of 10%P-NiSe2/CoSe2 can be attributed to the changes in charge density on the crystal surface and the lattice distortion in crystal caused by phosphorus doping. Our work provides an efficient approach for designing OER electrocatalysts through a LDHs derivation assembling with an anion doping method.",Journal of Alloys and Compounds
NiMoO4 @Co3S4 nanorods with core-shell structure for efficient hydrogen evolution reactions in electrocatalysts,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.High-efficiency electrocatalysts are required for the hydrogen evolution reaction processes used in clean-energy applications. Single-component materials have limited physicochemical properties and do not meet the requirements of high-performance material applications. More complex materials must therefore be developed for these purposes. This study involves growing flower cluster-like NiMoO4 nanorod arrays on reduced graphene oxide-modified nickel foam (NF/rGO) substrates by a simple two-step hydrothermal method, followed by NiMoO4 nanorod modification with Co3S4 nanoparticles, to achieve an efficient hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) strategy for NF/rGO/NiMoO4 @Co3S4 core-shell structure composite catalysts. The proposed vertically aligned NiMoO4 nanorods served as the core framework, providing abundant specific surface area and fast charge transfer channels. The Co3S4 particles grown on the NiMoO4 nanorods provided sufficient electrochemical active sites for full contact with the electrolyte solution. In the 1.0 M KOH solution, the NF/rGO/NiMoO4 @Co3S4 core-shell structure exhibited a low overpotential of 40 mV for HER at a current density of 10 mA cm−2. These properties indicate that the proposed material could be used in HER processes in energy applications.",Journal of Alloys and Compounds
Efficient electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction to ammonia with FeNi-Co/carbon mat electrodes,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction has recently received increasing attention due to its ability to synthesize ammonia under ambient conditions. However, the low ammonia yields and Faradaic efficiency hinder its further development, which necessitates the use of high-performance catalysts. Hence, in this study, a self-supporting carbon mat with FeNi-doped Co catalysts (Fe1Ni0.2Co145) fabricated by electrospinning was used as an electrode (FeNi-Co@CM) for electrochemical ammonia synthesis. The electrochemical performance of the FeNi-Co@CM electrode is evaluated in a three-electrode setup with FeNi-Co@CM as working electrode, a platinum mesh as counter electrode, and a Ag/AgCl electrode as reference electrode. The experimental investigations produce an ammonia yield rate of 27.9 μg h−1 mg−1 and a Faradaic efficiency of 1.52 % in 1.0 M KOH, which is higher than most of the reported data where iron-group-based electrocatalysts were employed. The verification results from multiple sets of control experiments indicated that the ammonia detected is generated by the nitrogen reduction reaction rather than the contaminants in the surrounding environment. In addition, the results of the stability test show that the FeNi-Co@CM electrode can maintain a high level of ammonia production for more than ten cycles. The working mechanism of nitrogen reduction reaction based on FeNi-Co@CM electrode is also discussed at various scales, including the electrode scale, the catalyst scale, and the atomic scale. This study therefore provides an in-depth understanding of the nitrogen reduction reaction from various perspectives, such as mass transport, reaction interfaces, and reaction intermediates.",Journal of Alloys and Compounds
Urea-oxidation-assisted electrochemical water splitting for hydrogen production on a bifunctional heterostructure transition metal phosphides combining metal–organic frameworks,"© 2022 Elsevier Inc.Electrocatalyzed urea-assisted wastewater splitting is a promising approach for sustainable hydrogen production. However, the lack of cost-efficient electrocatalysts hinders its practical application. Herein, bimetal phosphide (NiCoPx) nanowire arrays decorated with ultrathin NiFeCo metal–organic framework (NiFeCo-MOF) nanosheets on porous nickel foam (NF) were designed for urea-assisted wastewater splitting. The core–shell NiCoPx@NiFeCo-MOF hybrids were prepared via successive hydrothermal, gas-phase phosphorization and hydrothermal strategies. Encouragingly, the novel NiCoPx@NiFeCo-MOF/NF electrode served as an excellent bifunctional electrocatalyst for both the cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the anodic urea oxidation reaction (UOR) in urea-assisted water splitting, which merely required an overpotential of 44 mV to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm−2 for HER and a voltage of 1.37 V to deliver a current density of 100 mA cm−2 for UOR in 1.0 M KOH + 0.5 M urea. Benefiting from the highly exposed electroactive sites in exquisite three-dimensional (3D) hierarchical structure, multicomponent synergistic effect, accelerated electron transfer, easy electrolyte access and diffusion of released gas bubbles, the as-fabricated NiCoPx@NiFeCo-MOF/NF exhibited outstanding electrocatalytic performance. The mechanism of water splitting was elucidated by density functional theory calculations. Interestingly, NiFeCo-MOF possessed optimized COO* adsorption ability on Ni sites that were beneficial to UOR intermediates. More significantly, this work paves the way for the design and fabrication of bifunctional electrocatalysts for urea-containing wastewater treatment and sustainable hydrogen production.",Journal of Colloid and Interface Science
Accelerating hydroxyl desorption by swapping catalytic sites in RuMoS2+x cocatalysts for efficient alkaline photocatalytic H2 production,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Cost-effective MoS2 cocatalyst usually displays a low alkaline photocatalytic H2-evolution rate due to its sluggish hydroxyl-desorption kinetics and inert in-plane S atoms. Herein, a new strategy of swapping catalytic sites was developed to accelerate hydroxyl desorption of MoS2 cocatalysts, and the in-plane S-Hads bonds were effectively reinforced, realizing a rapid alkaline H2-evolution dynamic. Via a complex-mediated photodeposition pathway, S-rich RuMoS2+x nanodots incorporated with ultralow Ru atoms are perfectly anchored onto TiO2 nanoparticles to synthesize S-rich RuMoS2+x/TiO2 photocatalysts. In an alkaline enviroment, the S-rich RuMoS2+x/TiO2-7 photocatalyst delivers the highest H2-evolution rate, which is superior to the S-rich MoS2+x/TiO2 and crystalline MoS2/TiO2 sample. It is found that the catalytic sites for hydroxyl adsorption/desorption have been reversed from Mo to Ru atoms, and the Ru incorporation decreases the electron density of in-plane S atoms, thus accelerating hydroxyl desorption and reinforcing interfacial S-Hads to enhance alkaline H2-production rate of the S-rich RuMoS2+x/TiO2 photocatalysts.",Applied Catalysis B: Environmental
ZIF-8-derived N-doped porous carbon wrapped in porous carbon films as an air cathode for flexible solid-state Zn-air batteries,"© 2022 Elsevier Inc.Metal-organic frameworks are a new type of catalyst precursor with high specific surface area and controllable composition, which can be modified by post-treatment and are suitable for use as cathode catalysts for Zn-air batteries (ZABs). Here, a self-doped nitrogen nanocatalyst (N-PC@CF) with a double-layered porous structure is rationally designed for flexible solid-state ZABs. The outer porous carbon shell of the N-PC@CF is highly hydrophilic and O2 permeable, while the layered porous structure exposes sufficient active sites to shorten the mass transfer distance, which would promote electrocatalytic performance and increase flexibility efficiently. The obtained N-PC@CF has an onset potential of 0.926 V and a half-wave potential of 0.843 V in the oxygen reduction reaction test, which is equivalent to commercial Pt/C.

Interface engineering of NiMoSx heterostructure nanorods for efficient oxygen evolution reaction,"© 2022 Elsevier Inc.The development of electrocatalyst with efficient and stability for water oxidation is the key to enhance the efficiency of water electrolysis. Interface engineering can modify the local electronic structure of active sites, which is one of the important strategy to enhance catalytic activity. Herein, we synthesized NiMoSx heterostructure nanorods by simple hydrothermal method. The self supporting electrode of NiMoSx heterostructure nanorods grown in situ on nickel foam can reduce the indirect contact resistance between the substrate and the catalyst, and promote the timely release of bubbles produced by the oxygen evolution reaction. The heterogeneous interface in NiMoSx can provide abundant electroactive centers and optimize the adsorption energy of active intermediates. NiMoSx heterostructure nanorods showed excellent oxygen evolution catalytic activity (η100 = 279 mV, η1000 = 436 mV, Tafel slope b = 72.3 mV dec−1) and more than 200 hours of sustainable durability in 1 M KOH. When NiMoSx heterostructure nanorods are used as anode materials for water electrolysis, the electrolytic cell could obtain 10 mA cm−2 at 1.48 V. The current research results not only show that NiMoSx nanostructure is an excellent oxygen evolution electrocatalyst, At the same time, it also provides a valuable interface regulation method for the design of high-performance heterostructure electrocatalyst.",Journal of Colloid and Interface Science

Structure optimization of ZIF-12-derived Co-N-C for efficient oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdThe rational design and preparation of bifunctional electrocatalysts with high catalytic performance for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are extremely crucial for the development of fuel cells and regenerative metal-air cells. In this work, a simple compound-assisted pyrolyzing strategy is reported to synthesize Co-N-C (CoNC-xcompound-800) materials by high-temperature annealing of ZIF-12. Results show that the physicochemical properties of the obtained CoNC-xcompound-800 are dependent on the type of the assistant compound. With the introduction of organic compound (i.e., C3H6N6, C6H14O6, C16H32O2, CH3(CH2)16COOH, C6H5NO3), the specific surface area, the carbon defect content, the content of pyridinic-N and graphitic-N, and the Co-Nx concentration of the obtained CoNC-0.5compound(organic)-800 are greatly increased, which result in the improved activities of the 0.5compound(organic)-800 samples. Differently, with the addition of inorganic compound (i.e., Na3PO4, KCl, K2CO3), the carbon defect content, the content of pyridinic-N and graphitic-N, and the Co-Nx concentration of the obtained CoNC-0.5compound(inorganic)-800 are greatly decreased, which lead to reduced activities of the 0.5compound(inorganic)-800 samples. Among these materials, the CoNC-0.5C6H14O6-800 shows satisfactory ORR performance with a half-wave potential of 0.89 V. Meanwhile, CoNC-0.5C6H14O6-800 exhibits an optimal OER performance with an overpotential being only 425 mV at current density of 10 mA cm−2. Our work provides a simple and universal method to adjust the physicochemical properties of the ZIF-12-derived Co-N-C materials. Besides, the results demonstrate that optimal pore structure, higher carbon defect content, higher content of pyridinic-N and graphitic-N, and higher Co-Nx concentration are of great importance for the improvement of the electrochemical performances of the Co-N-C catalysts.",Fuel
Structural engineering and electronic state tuning optimization of molybdenum-doped cobalt hydroxide nanosheet self-assembled hierarchical microtubules for efficient electrocatalytic oxygen evolution,"© 2022 Elsevier Inc.Cobalt-based hydroxide are ideal candidates for the oxygen evolution reaction. Herein, we use molybdenum oxide nanorods as sacrificial templates to construct a self-supporting molybdenum-doped cobalt hydroxide nanosheet hierarchical microtubule structure based on a structural engineering strategy to improve the active area of the catalyst. X-ray-based spectroscopic tests revealed that Mo (VI) with tetrahedral coordination intercalated into the interlayer of cobalt hydroxide, promoting interlayer separation. At the same time, Mo is connected with Co through oxygen bonds, which promotes the transfer of Co charges to Mo and reduces the electron cloud density of Co ions. In 1 M KOH, optimized molybdenum-doped cobalt hydroxide nanosheet microtubules only needs an overpotential of 288 mV to drive a current density of 10 mA cm−2, which is significantly better than that of pure Co(OH)2 nanosheets and RuO2. Structural engineering and electronic state regulation can effectively improve the oxygen evolution activity of cobalt-based hydroxide, which provides a design idea for the development of efficient oxygen evolution catalysts.",Journal of Colloid and Interface Science

Heterostructure engineering of iridium species on nickel/molybdenum nitride for highly-efficient anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer,"© 2022 Elsevier Inc.Developing highly active electrocatalysts is a pivotal issue for anion-exchange membrane water electrolyzers (AEMWE). However, realizing the continuous hydrogen generation at a large current density remains challenging. Herein, a novel kind of hybrid electrode is successfully developed by introducing trace iridium (Ir) species onto a hierarchical Ni/Mo5N6 heterostructure on Ni foam (Ir-Ni/Mo5N6/NF). The synergistic advantages of high conductivity, abundant active sites, and strong electronic interaction endow superior reaction kinetics, presenting a highly-active bifunctional electrocatalyst. Remarkably, the Ir-Ni/Mo5N6/NF exhibit extremely low overpotentials of 52 mV and 250 mV at 100 mA cm−2 for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). By exploiting the Ir-Ni/Mo5N6 as both anode/cathode, the constructed AEMWE device delivers superior performance. The current density reaches 2.1 A cm−2 at a voltage of 2.0 V and 250 mA cm−2 at 1.8 V in alkaline/neutral media.

Anchoring highly-dispersed ZnCdS nanoparticles on NiCo Prussian blue Analogue-derived cubic-like NiCoP forms an S-scheme heterojunction for improved hydrogen evolution,"© 2022 Elsevier Inc.This study used a facile hydrothermal technique to obtain a novel ZnCdS/NiCoP S-scheme heterojunction for highly photocatalytic H2 generation, Notably, phosphatization was used to derive the cubic NiCoP from a Prussian blue analog ZnCdS nanoparticles are simple to disperse on the surface because NiCoP has a cubic characteristic, which easily transfers interface charges, and consequently accelerates surface reaction kinetics. Furthermore, the ZnCdS/NiCoP-3% composite exhibited the highest photocatalytic H2 generation performance of 582.98 µmol with an apparent quantum yield (AQY) of 7.93% at 450 nm in the lactic acid aqueous solution, which is approximately 4.16 and 500-fold higher than that of the pure ZnCdS and NiCoP, respectively. Additionally, outstanding photostability was achieved after 20h of the four cycling experiments. Consequently, the peachy photocatalytic hydrogen evolution can be imputed for establishing S-scheme heterojunction, maintaining doughty redox capacity and achieving spatial separation of charges, thereby vastly restraining the fast recombination of photoexcitation. Furthermore, the photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy and hydroxyl radical (OH[rad]) capture experiments further proved the S-scheme mechanism. Therefore, this study provides a neoteric perspective establishing S-scheme photocatalytic systems for solar energy conversion.",Journal of Colloid and Interface Science

The Au precursors were reduced into Au clusters around the edges of Pd nanosheets (NSs) via galvanic replacement, then the center of Pd NSs was oxidatively etched by Cl−/O2, and finally the Pd and Au atoms on the edge sites were rearranged to form uniform PdAu alloy. PdAu NRs with different ratios and ternary PdAuPt NRs could be easily prepared using this strategy.

Yolk-shell Fe3O4@Carbon@Platinum-Chlorin e6 nanozyme for MRI-assisted synergistic catalytic-photodynamic-photothermal tumor therapy,"© 2022 Elsevier Inc.Hypothesis: Tumor treatments based on phototherapy, such as photodynamic therapy (PDT) and photothermal therapy (PTT), are promising anticancer strategies. However, their dependence on light also poses several limitations for their application. Therefore, the establishment of a multifunctional nanotheranostic platform based on light therapy is needed to improve applicability of the technology. Experiments: We designed yolk-shell magnetic Fe3O4@Carbon@Platinum-Chlorin e6 nanoparticles (MCPtCe6), which may be used for Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and synergistic catalytic-photodynamic-photothermal (catalytic-PDT-PTT) tumor therapy. Findings: We designed to compound multiple nanozymes and solve the drawbacks of single nanozyme and give additional functionalization to nanozymes for tumor therapy. Fe3O4 has T2 weighted MRI ability. The designed yolk-shell structure can disperse Fe3O4 in the carbon shell layer, which in turn can act as a carrier for PtNPs and improve the dispersion of both Fe3O4 and Pt. Pt nanoparticles attached to the surface of N-doped carbon spheres enhanced the catalytic ability of the nanozyme to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS). The covalently linked photosensitizer chlorin e6 (Ce6) on the Fe3O4@C@Pt (MCPt) nanozyme is essential for the therapeutic effects of PDT. MCPtCe6 can be specifically activated by the microenvironment through an enzyme-like catalytic process and extend PDT/PTT in acidic and H2O2-rich microenvironments. The results showed that MCPtCe6 had a high photothermal conversion efficiency (η = 28.28%), indicating its feasibility for PTT. Further cellular and animal studies have revealed that catalytic-PDT-PTT therapy can effectively inhibit tumors both in vitro and in vivo.",Journal of Colloid and Interface Science

A co-doped oxygen reduction catalyst with FeCu promotes the stability of microbial fuel cells,"© 2022 Elsevier Inc.Air cathode microbial fuel cell (AC-MFC) cannot be used on a large scale because of its low oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) efficiency. Despite the fact that bimetallic catalysts can greatly enhance the oxygen reduction rate by regulating the electronic structure of the active site, the flaws of insufficient exposure of the active site and easy metal agglomeration limit its catalytic activity. Herein, we report on the preparation of a stable heteroatomic substrate using a copper material organic framework as a precursor, covered by Fe-based active sites. As a result of dipole-dipole interactions, the reduced product Fe2+ forms a weak Fe-O surface that is conducive to the adsorption of active substances. The presence of Fe0 enhances the electrical conductivity of the catalytic, thus promoting ORR efficiency. Through redox coupling, the D-band center of Fe at FeCu@CN is optimized and brought close to the Fermi level to facilitate electron transfer. Notably, FeCu@CN demonstrates a superior power density of 2796.23 ± 278.58 mW m−3, far exceeding that of Pt/C (1363.93 ± 102.56 mW m−3), in the application of microbial fuel cells (MFCs). Meanwhile, the MFC-loaded FeCu@CN maintains excellent stability and outstanding output voltage after 1000 h, which provides feasibility for large-scale application.",Journal of Colloid and Interface Science

Characterization by powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), solid-state Cross-Polarization Magic-Angle-Spinning Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (CP/MAS NMR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) established the structures of the as-prepared catalysts. Inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES) detection showed that the loading of Pd nanoparticles (Pd NPs) were 29.4 wt% for Pd@PAF–182 and 37.5 wt% for Pd@PAF–183, much higher than those of similar porous materials. Evaluation of the catalytic activity of the Pd@PAFs using Suzuki coupling as the model reaction demonstrated that as little as 0.12 mol% of Pd NPs could catalyze the Suzuki coupling with high efficiency, achieving yields up to 99% at 80 °C in 8 h. Recycling experiments also suggested that Pd@PAF–182 and Pd@PAF–183 maintained high catalytic activity with negligible leaching of Pd NPs after five cycles.",Journal of Colloid and Interface Science

Bifunctional copper-cobalt spinel electrocatalysts for efficient tandem-like nitrate reduction to ammonia,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Electrocatalytic reduction of nitrate (NO3−, NO3RR) provides an effective strategy to mitigate water pollution of human-caused but obtain high-value ammonia (NH3) under environmental conditions based on renewable energy. In this study, we prepared porous carbon nanofibers (CFs)-supported CuCo2O4 composite (CuCo2O4/CFs) electrocatalyst by electrospun-pyrolysis method for efficient conversion of NO3− to NH3. The experimental results revealed that the CFs could contribute to charge transfer and inhibit the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), which preferentially catalyzes NO3−-to-NO2−. On the other hand, internally confined CuCo2O4 nanoparticles conduce to stabilize adsorbed nitrite intermediate (*NO2) for further conversion to NH3. The CuCo2O4/CFs exhibit the maximum NH3 Faradaic efficiency of 81.9 % at − 0.3 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (vs RHE) with a yield rate of 394.5 mmol h−1 g−1 at ambient conditions. The theoretical analysis demonstrated that the *NH3 desorption is a potential rate-determining step (RDS) with an uphill energy change of 0.76 eV over CuCo2O4. Furthermore, CuCo2O4/CFs as difunctional catalysts, coupling NO3− reduction with methanol oxidation (NO3RR||MOR) to substitute water splitting simultaneously at a low voltage.

An integrated strategy for upgrading Li-CO2 batteries: Redox mediator and separator modification,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.In Li-CO2 battery, redox mediators (RMs) are considered to have bright prospects due to their advantages of optimizing the mediated reaction pathway and reducing over-potential. However, some inherent defects caused by RMs, such as induced Li anode degradation and electron shuttle, limit its application in Li-CO2 battery. In this work, ruthenium acetylacetonate (Ru(acac)3) was innovatively applied as an efficient RM to boost the performance of Li-CO2 battery, and the “shuttle effect” of Ru(acac)3 to Li anode was also confirmed. To avoid the anode degradation caused by “shuttle effect” of RM, a novel Zn-MOF nanoplate modified glass fiber (M-GF) separator is skillfully prepared and used as a dual-function separator for Li-CO2 battery. Experiments coupled with density functional theory simulations verifies that M-GF can protect Li anode by preventing Ru(acac)3 from entering Li anode by physical and chemical interactions. Moreover, the highly ordered micropores in Zn-MOF also induce uniform deposition of Li+ on the Li anode to delay the degradation process of anode, and thus prolonged the cycle life of the battery. Thanks to the bidirectional support of Ru(acac)3 and M-GF strategy, the electrochemical performances of the Li-CO2 battery, especially the round-trip efficiency and cycle life, has been greatly improved.",Chemical Engineering Journal

Efficient tetracycline degradation via peroxymonosulfate activation by magnetic Co/N co-doped biochar: Emphasizing the important role of biochar graphitization,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.The accumulation of tetracycline (TC) in aquatic environments raised the risk to ecosystems and human health due to its potential biological toxicity. The development of carbon-based materials with features of low cost, easy isolation and excellent performance for activating peroxymonosulfate (PMS) to generate reactive oxygen species toward TC degradation is essential but remains a grand challenge. Herein, sustainable biomass kelp-derived self-nitrogen doped biochar (KC)-stabilized Co nanoparticles were developed for PMS activation toward TC degradation. The influences of calcination temperature on the microstructure were studied to further optimize the degradation performance for TC.

Boosting peroxymonosulfate activation by porous single-atom catalysts with FeN4O1 configuration for efficient organic pollutants degradation,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.The construction of single Fe atoms with favorable electron structures is highly desired to boost peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation for organics degradation. Herein, this study embedded isolated Fe atoms on N, O co-doped porous carbon substrate (FeSA-N/O–C), and first found the constructed FeN4O1 configuration can realize efficient PMS activation via electron transfer by inner-sphere complexation, instead of the usual reactive oxygen species (ROS) as a major role. Structural investigation showed that the FeN4O1 moieties possess high content of high spin (HS) Fe(II), resulting in the delocalization of unpaired electrons around Fe centers, which is benefit to transfer electrons when reacted with PMS. EIS and LSV curves further certified the electron transfer process. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations unveiled that the FeN4O1 configuration can directly adsorb O–O bond of PMS, leading to electron accumulation around Fe-O2 bond, and then ulteriorly trigger the electron shuttling in organics degradation. Consequently, the optimized FeSA-N/O–C/PMS system exhibited superior oxidation ability for various organic pollutants, and was not affected by initial pH variation (3.19 ∼ 10.89), inorganic anions (ClO4−, Cl− and H2PO4−) and natural organic matter (NOM) interference. Importantly, the developed system presented certain applicability in the treatment of actual water from Taihu Lake basin, China. Hence, this study not only elucidates the inner-sphere complexation-oriented electron transfer mechanism between unique FeN4O1 configuration and PMS, but provides new insights into engineered single atom catalysts for wastewater purification.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Upscaling studies for efficiently electric-driven CO2 reduction to CO in ionic liquid-based electrolytes,"© 2022Electric-driven CO2 reduction to high value-added chemicals is a potential way to solve the carbon emissions. However, the current studies on CO2 electroreduction (CO2ER) are mainly focused on design and preparation of novel electrocatalysts and electrolytes. The large-scale of CO2ER is puzzled in the serious hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in aqueous electrolytes and inferior reaction stability in an enlarged CO2 electrolyzer. Ionic liquids (ILs) as electrolytes have opened great opportunities for CO2ER due to their unique advantages. Herein, a large-scale CO2ER device containing an upscaling modified H-type flow cell using IL-based electrolytes (UHFC-IL) with the largest electrode active area of 495 cm2 was established for CO2ER studies. The influences of key operating parameters, such as compositions of IL-based electrolytes, electrolytes velocity, CO2 gas flow rate and cell voltage on CO2ER performance were systematically investigated. A high CO2ER performance under the optimum operating conditions achieves 83.9% Faraday Efficiency (FE) for CO with a reaction current of 6.32 A, suppressing HER to only 2% FE. After 10 hr continuous operation, the CO selectivity in IL-based electrolytes is 51.3% higher than that in 0.1 M KHCO3 aqueous electrolytes, which maintains excellent stability with a high CO generation rate of 1.7 L hr-1. In addition, the mechanism of CO2ER to CO boosted by IL-based electrolytes in UHFC-IL was proposed. This study provides experimental parameters and guidance for future research on the amplification process of CO2ER.",Chemical Engineering Journal

In this study, CuCo@GCNs/PMS system exhibited excellent TC removal efficiency (0.182 min−1), which was unaffected by various water matrices and applicable to a wide pH range (3.44–8.44). Radicals (SO4•−, •OH, and O2•−) and non-radical (1O2) pathways collectively contributed to catalytic TC oxidation based on quenching experiments and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) analysis. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that the mechanism of PMS molecules activated on the surface of CuCo@GCNs, in which CoO provided more catalytic sites while Cu2O further enhanced electron transfer. Moreover, the synergistic effect of CuCo bimetal could accelerate redox cycles of Cu+/Cu2+ and Co2+/Co3+, inducing the generation of abundant oxygen vacancies (OVs), thus enhancing PMS activation performance. Three potential TC degradation pathways were proposed according to fifteen possible intermediates detected by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS).

Nonetheless, the imbalanced kinetics between the sluggish battery-type cathode and the rapid capacitor-type anode make it difficult for HSCs to achieve high energy density at high power density. Herein, a novel N-doped carbon quantum dots/Ni-Co-Se (N-CQDs/Ni-Co-Se) hollow microspheres composite is synthesized via a facile hydrothermal approach using bifunctional CQDs as size regulators and conductive agents for the first time. Thanks to the synergism of highly conductive N-CQDs with rapid electron transfer and reduced-size hollow micro-/nanostructures contributing to the enhanced ion transport, the as-prepared battery-type N-CQDs/Ni-Co-Se hollow microspheres composite cathode exhibits admirable rate property.

Single atom catalysts, are attracting considerable attention for CO2RR because of their high atom utilization efficiencies and tailored electron states. However, the catalytic sites remain limited and developing novel catalytic centers is a significant and challenge.

Here, the multi-functional nanocomposite involving Co-doped molybdenum phosphide (Co-MoP) nanofibers and porous carbon nanofibers (PCNFs) is designed and prepared through electro-blow spinning and phosphating process, which possesses multiple adsorption and catalytic sites and is acted as the functional material for LSBs separators.

Tuning the wettability of advanced mesoporous Fe[sbnd]N[sbnd]C catalysts for optimizing the construction of the gas/liquid/solid three-phase interface in air-cathodes,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.To explore high-efficient Fe[sbnd]N[sbnd]C oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalysts, remarkable efforts have been made to search the active sites with superior ORR activity and increase the site density and exposure. However, the active sites are not utilized in fuel cells unless they are located at the gas/liquid/solid three-phase interface that can simultaneously get in touch with ions and oxygen. Tuning the wettability of the catalyst layer (CL) is a key to enlarging the three-phase interface. Here, we adjusted the wettability of Fe[sbnd]N[sbnd]C catalysts and thus obtained a series of ORR electrodes with different CL wettability. Various electrochemical methods were linked and carried out to quantitatively investigate how the wettability influences the electrode behaviors including current response, electrochemical surface area, impedance, and oxygen and ion diffusion coefficient. The results revealed that the electrode behaviors are quite sensitive to the wettability of CL. Moreover, the construction of the three-phase interface that requires a coupling development of gas and liquid channels ultimately determines the electrode performance. In detail, the liquid channels of the water superwettable electrode and the gas channels of the gas superwettable electrode were both overdeveloped, which caused that the electrolyte-wetted surfaces of the former are not fully exposed to gas and lots of gas-exposed surfaces of the latter cannot be wetted by electrolytes. While the electrode with moderate gas and water wettability succeeded in a sufficient coupling development of gas and liquid channels and thus exhibited an optimal three-phase interface and a boosted cathode performance.",Chemical Engineering Journal

Here in, we design and fabricate Cu/Ni bimetallic phosphides with Graphdiyne (GDY) to form hybrid nanomaterial CuNiPx-GDY on Ni foam for the first time. The synergistical effect between GDY and transition metal phosphides, and the atomic scale heterojunctions between Cu3P and Ni2P, effectively accelerate the catalytical process both in HER and OER, resulting in extraordinarily small overpotentials of 178 mV and 110 mV at 10 mA cm−2 for OER and HER in CuNiPx-GDY(1:1) in 1 M KOH, respectively. Density functional theory results show that, compared with pure CuNiPx, the introduced GDY can considerably improve the activity of OER and generate different active sites for OER and HER in CuNiPx-GDY(1:1). Thus CuNiPx-GDY(1:1) exhibits good catalytical performance and stability as catalyst for overall water splitting.

Herein, we provide the novel design and synthesis of an advanced category of CeO2/CoS2 heterostructures, which combines the local photothermal effect (LPTE) action of CeO2 and the photoelectric effect CoS2 to boost OER. Interestingly, the hollow framework, rich heterointerface, coupled local photothermal effect and photoelectric effect equip CeO2/CoS2 with remarkably excellent electrocatalytic OER performance. As a result, the optimized CeO2/CoS2-6 only needs an overpotential of 283 mV to reach 10 mA cm−2 as well as a smaller Tafel slop of 33.2 mV dec-1, outperforming the RuO2 catalyst (323 mA @ 10 mA cm−2). Upon combination of experimental data and mechanistic study, it is revealed that the enhanced OER performance is primarily ascribed to the photo-induced local thermal. partly resulting from photoelectric effect, where the photogenerated electron flow from CeO2 to CoS2 can photogenerated holes in CeO2 to boost water oxidation.

Herein, a metal-support structure consisting of silver (Ag) nanoparticles supported by MoO42− intercalated Co-LDH (CoMo-LDH) nanocages (Ag@CoMo-LDH) was developed using a sacrificial template method and a subsequent spontaneous strategy. The resultant hybrid was shown to be a highly efficient OER electrocatalyst in alkaline media. The required overpotential of Ag@CoMo-LDH for affording a geometric current density of 10 mA cm−2 is as low as 205 mV, which is not only significantly lower than that of separate CoMo-LDH or Ag nanoparticles but also superior to that of most developed OER electrocatalysts reported recently. The constituents and respective work mechanism of Ag@CoMo-LDH are discussed in detail. The superior performance of Ag@CoMo-LDH is related to the unique construction and the effective and stable heterointerfaces between Ag nanoparticles and CoMo-LDH, which accelerate the electron and mass transfer, provide a large number of new active sites and optimize the activity of the original sites. Impressively, Ag@CoMo-LDH also exhibited promising practical prospect on account of the remarkable cyclic and long-term stability. This finding demonstrates that pointedly integrating multiple strategies into one system is a promising way to construct new LDH-based OER electrocatalysts with synthetically improved performance, providing a promising model for developing advanced electrocatalysts in energy conversion devices.",Journal of Colloid and Interface Science

By performing first-principles calculations, we systematically explore MoSi2N4 decorated with 3d and 4d period transition metal single atoms (TMSAs) as efficient CO2 reduction photocatalysts and find that product selectivity is highly correlated with the d-band center of TMSAs. Compressive and tensile strains in mutually perpendicular directions are introduced in the horizontal plane to improve the catalytic performance. After filtering, V, Mn, and Ni were found to be the best TMSAs for CO, HCOOH, and CH4 production, respectively. Ni/MoSi2N4 under −6% tensile strain exhibited the lowest CO2 reduction limiting potential (UL) of 0.24 V. Notably, the time-dependent ab initio nonadiabatic molecular dynamics simulations were carried out to elucidate the photogenerated electron transport properties, where the photo-generated electrons can be efficiently transferred from MoSi2N4 to TMSAs active sites.

In this work, the FeCo/Fe3C-CNC composite was prepared by anchoring FeCo/Fe3C nanoparticles onto the crosslinked N-doped Carbon (CNC). The results showed that the addition of Co element improved the electrochemical activity of Co-Fe alloy through tuning the electronic structure of Fe atoms. The carbon nanotubes (CNTs) grown around Co-Fe alloy and Fe3C nanoparticles exhibited a strong affinity to polysulfide species and superior catalytic capability as nano-reactors. The N-doping CNTs/carbon sheets (CS) facilitated the formation of Li2S compound by promoting the Li+ ions transport while hindering the polysulfide shuttle effect.

However, current system still suffers from weak reagent supply and high reaction barrier, and modulating the structural/electronic configurations of electrocatalysts with optimized properties plays a vital role for achieving efficient NRR. Herein, distorted spinel ferrite heterostructure is rationally designed via large-scale substitution of alkaline earth metal with large atomic radius, and serves as a highly active and selective NRR electrocatalyst. The distorted structure generates superior N2 affinity to realize its localization, which is beneficial for the following adsorption. Moreover, the number of electrons occupied at the Fermi level of active sites is greatly increased, so that the electron transfer to the adsorbed N2 is efficiently facilitated and the reaction barrier is significantly reduced. Such optimized electronic structure also dramatically increases the reaction barrier of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), allowing H+ to preferentially participate in the nitrogen hydrogenation. With boosted NRR and suppressed HER, an outstanding NRR performance with a superior Faradaic efficiency of 76.7 % and a high NH3 yield rate of 36.4 μg h−1 mg−1 is achieved under ambient conditions.

However, the electrolysis of CO2 often limited by a long diffusion pathway and high mass transfer resistance from electrolyte to the surface of catalysts. In this paper, we propose a bubbling fluidized electrode with catalyst/ionomer interface design, allowing an efficient gas transport and a high local CO2 concentration near the surface of catalysts. By applying above design strategy, the bubbling fluidized electrode exhibits a remarkably decreased diffusion length of CO2 as low as several nanometers and delivers a high selectivity with a faradic efficiency of ∼100 % at −0.4 V vs RHE. The universality of the interface design is further verified by using different hydrophobic materials, achieving a remarkably improved performance. In the actual application, a photoelectrochemical cell equipped with the bubbling fluidized electrode shows a high stability with a FE > 90 %. These results demonstrate a viable strategy to facilitate the electrolysis process involving gas-electrolyte-solid phase reactions (e.g., CO2 reduction reaction) through a bubbling fluidized electrode with catalyst/ionomer interface design.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Tensile strained PdNi bimetallene for energy-efficient hydrogen production integrated with formate oxidation,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Strain engineering is a prospective approach to enhance catalytic performance of electrocatalysts. Herein, we report a CO-confined growth method for the synthesis of tensile-strained PdNi bimetallene as bifunctional catalyst for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and formate oxidation reaction (FOR). Ascribed to electronic effect and strain effect derived from the introduction of Ni and ultrathin curved geometry, PdNi bimetallene possesses sufficient active sites and modulates the adsorption/dissociation of electrocatalytic intermediates, resulting in outstanding activity and stability for HER and FOR. In HER-FOR system, a low cell voltage of 0.51 V is achieved at 20 mA cm−2 by PdNi bimetallene, which is 1.21 V lower than that for the conventional water electrolysis. This work offers a versatile route for the synthesis of crimped bimetallene materials for advanced energy-efficient hydrogen production and beyond.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Selective laser sintering of PEG treated inorganic fullerene-like tungsten disulfide nanoparticles/polyamide 12 nanocomposites and fire safety behavior,"© 2022Research has focused on developing advanced polyamide 12(PA12) engineering plastics with low flammability and low levels of smoke evolution during combustion. To satisfy green and safe industrial criteria, it is essential to minimize the emission of smoke and harmful gases generated during the burning of PA12. As a result, utilizing inorganic fullerene-liked tungsten sulfide (IF-WS2) nanoparticles as the precursor and polyethylene glycol (PEG) as the interfacial functional agent, a flame retardant grafted with the –OH functional group on the surface of IF-WS2 nanoparticles was designed and synthesized. Selective laser sintering (SLS) was used to fabricate the PA12/F-IF-WS2 nanocomposites. The multiple –OH groups provided by PEG could enhance the hydrogen bonding active sites of F-IF-WS2 nanoparticles and PA12 molecular chain groups, which could further boost the flame-retardant efficiency of PA12. The apparent decline in the peak heat release (26.55%), peak smoke generation (23%), and total CO production (40.4%) values proved the increased fire safety of the PA12 composite. Depending on the characterization results, a possible flame-retardant mechanism was proposed. Furthermore, the addition of F-IF-WS2 had a decisive effect on mechanical properties, including tensile properties, and dynamic mechanical properties. The PA12/F-IF-WS2 nanocomposites prepared using SLS molding provide a new direction for preparation and flame-retardant applications.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Anti-CO2 strategies for extending Zinc-Air Batteries’ Lifetime: A review,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Zinc-air batteries (ZABs) are promising candidates for post-lithium-ion battery technology owing to their safe, low-cost, and eco-friendly nature. However, ZABs suffer from CO2 corrosion, which leads to quick battery deterioration and severely limits their applications. Here, we explain the reason behind ZAB failure by CO2 corrosion and systematically review various anti-CO2 strategies for liquid and flexible ZABs. Recent advances are highlighted, and the effectiveness of these strategies in extending battery lifetime is evaluated. Current challenges and perspectives for the future development of anti-CO2 ZABs are also provided. We believe this review will deliver a comprehensive sight for anti-CO2 ZABs.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Interfacial engineering of Co-doped 1T-MoS2 coupled with V2C MXene for efficient electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Earth-abundant MoS2 has attracted great attentions as a promising hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) electrocatalyst, but it is limited by sluggish water dissociation and strong adsorption of the oxygen-containing intermediates in alkaline media. Herein, an interfacial engineering strategy to fabricate Co-doped 1T-MoS2 coupling with V2C MXene was reported to improve the HER kinetics of MoS2. DFT calculations predict that the construction of heterogeneous interfaces between V2C MXene and Co-doped 1T-MoS2 can effectively reduce the energy barrier of water dissociation and optimize the free energy of hydrogen adsorption. As a result, the synthesized Co-MoS2/V2C@CC nanohybrid exhibits excellent HER performance with small overpotentials of 70.1, 263.2 and 296 mV to achieve current densities of 10, 500 and 1000 mA cm−2, respectively, and outstanding stability for 50 h HER test without degradation. Additionally, the overall hydrazine-assisted water splitting (OHzS) system catalyzed by Co-MoS2/V2C@CC in both anode and cathode requires only 0.33 V to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm−2 with significant long-term durability.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Bi vacancy simultaneous manipulation of bulk adsorption and carrier utilization to replenish the mechanism of Cr(VI) photoreduction at universal pH,"© 2022Constructing atomic-level cation vacancies is an effective strategy to modulate the electronic properties of host materials, thus promoting charge transfer and redox reaction kinetics. Herein, ultrathin Bi24O31Br10 nanosheets with cationic vacancy was synthesized via an inventive precipitation strategy by adding appropriate arginine. The difunctional arginine can changes the pH of the synthetic system and selectively deprive Bi atoms on the surface to form Bi vacancies through strong affinity between functional groups and cations. The abundant Bi vacancy decrease the Gibbs free energy change and provide channels to promote bulk adsorption of Cr(VI), thus effectively reduces the carrier migration distance during in situ bulk photocatalytic reduction of Cr(VI) and induces the formation of new impurity states to improve the utilization of visible light. Bi vacancy mitigates strong excitonic effects confined by significantly reducing exciton binding energies, thus effectively promote the separation of photo-generated charges and suppress reorganization of photon-generated carrier. Benefiting from these merits, these exclusive VBi-Bi24O31Br10 ultra-thin nanosheets exhibit superior reduction performance for Cr(VI), and the removal rate was more than 90% at universal pH (2–10). This work provides a new idea for the construction of cation vacancies and a feasible method for the removal of Cr(VI) under alkaline conditions.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Highly efficient removing refractory organics continuously using a Fenton-like Filter: The role of in-situ galvanic effect enhanced peroxymonosulfate activation,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation by heterogeneous catalysts is a promising method for removing organic contaminants in wastewater. However, recovery and stability of the catalyst limit its practical applications. Here we demonstrate that Co incorporated chitosan and immobilized on carbon-fiber (CF) sheets (Co-N/CF) by annealing can catalytically activate PMS for efficiently degrading refractory organic pollutants, and show excellent stability and recovery within a Fenton-like filtration device. Batch tests reveal the excellent activity of the Co-N/CF and the optimized synthesis condition. Radical-quenching experiments and EPR measurements confirm that the generated singlet oxygen (1O2) is the main reactive species. Excellent continuously treating performance is obtained under various conditions, including different initial organic concentration, various organic pollutants, PMS dosage, pH, co-existing anions, and natural organic matter. For example, under the conditions of 20 mg L−1 RhB, 25 ppm PMS and a flux rate of 15 mL min−1, the reactor can maintain 100% RhB removal rate for more than 32 h while the Co leaching is much lower than the standard value. Interestingly, in the presence of electrolytes, the removal rate can keep 100% under a much higher flux rate over 450 mL min−1, which is about 16 times higher than the wastewater without electrolyte. Based on the differential concentration in the filter and the conductivity of carbon based Co-N/CF and electrolyte, an in-situ galvanic effect between the upper and lower Co-N/CF plates can be formed, which can boost the generation of reactive species, thereby significantly improving the degradation performance. Present study provided a rational strategy for PMS activation in equipment level, and also presented a new insight into the mechanism of PMS heterogeneous activation.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Interfacial microenvironment-regulated cascade charge transport in Co6Mo6C2-MoO2-CoNC@ZnIn2S4 photocatalyst for efficient hydrogen evolution,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.High-quality interfacial coupling can effectively boost photogenerated charge separation/transfer efficiency. Herein, we develop a multicomponent photocatalyst, Co6Mo6C2-MoO2-CoNC@ZnIn2S4 (CMN@Z), featuring directional and swift carrier transfer ability through interfacial microenvironment modulation. The distinctive CMN@Z displays a ten-times enhanced photocatalytic H2-production performance of 4728 μmol·g−1·h−1 than pure ZIS, accompanied by optimized apparent quantum efficiency of 25.06 % at 420 nm. Typically, the well-tuned Schottky barrier readily balances its bifunctionality in rectifying effect and powerful photogenerated electron extraction impetus. Moreover, the gradient work function variation enables the interfacial potential as a robust driving force to expedite charge transfer. Therefore, the resulting cascade charge channel and intimate interfacial contact endow CMN@Z photocatalyst with optimized H2-production performance by virtue of high-efficiency carrier spatial separation and utilization. Our work deeply explores the role of multiple interfacial in coupling photocatalytic systems, which offers new insight into the rational design of cascade photocatalysts.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Yolk-shell Co catalysts with controlled nanoparticle/single-atom ratio for aqueous levulinic acid hydrogenation to γ-valerolactone,"© 2022Precise and facile tailoring of metal nanoparticle/single-atom ratio to optimize the catalytic hydrogenation activity and durability is important yet challenging, owing to the lack of efficient synthetic methodology. Herein, we report a brand-new Co catalyst with precisely tailored Co NP/Co SA ratio encapsulated into a hollow carbon sphere, skillfully fabricated by stepwise coating of bimetallic Zn/Co zeolitic imidazole frameworks with silica and 8-quinolinol modified chitosan before pyrolysis and acid washing. The transformation of the target catalyst and the tailoring of Co NP/Co SA ratio are well investigated by various characterization techniques including TEM, aberration-corrected scanning TEM (AC-STEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS), etc. It is found that the yolk-shell structured Co catalyst integrated with nearly equivalent nanoparticles and sing-atoms are highly active and stable towards aqueous levulinic acid (LA) hydrogenation to γ-valerolactone (GVL). Combined with H2-TPD and LA adsorbed FT-IR investigations, it is revealed that the superior activity originates from the synergism of Co nanoparticles and single-atoms, since H2 dissociation and C[dbnd]O adsorption are facilitated by Co nanoparticles and single-atoms, respectively, leading to a lowered energy barrier during the hydrogenation reaction. This study will shed light on the precise tailoring of metal nanoparticle/single-atom ratio and also provides a new insight into the development of highly efficient non-noble metal catalysts for sustainable biomass conversion.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Cooperative catalytic Mo-S-Co heterojunctions with sulfur vacancies for kinetically boosted lithium-sulfur battery,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.The intelligent design of catalytic materials with unique architectures has a significant impact on regulating the polysulfides (LiPSs) conversion and boosting the performance of Li − S batteries. Here, starting from 2D catalytic MoS2 nanosheets and combined with the first-principle calculations, the covalent heterojunction and S vacancy are simultaneously developed in MoS2 to regulate the electronic structure and improve the LiPSs conversion kinetics. The S vacancy and heterojunction (MoS2-x-Co9S8-y) engineering can significantly improve the electrical conductivity of MoS2 by incorporating shallow donor levels into the MoS2. Moreover, the incorporation of Co9S8-y greatly improves the chemisorption ability of heterostructure towards LiPSs. The LiPSs are preferentially adsorbed at the catalytic Mo-S-Co heterojunction, where both Li+ and e- are easy to access. The coupled fast Li+/e- transportation of MoS2-x-Co9S8-y enables direct and fast LiPSs “adsorption-conversion” at the catalytic Mo-S-Co heterojunction with enhanced bidirectional catalytic properties. Due to the ingenious co-engineering of S vacancy and heterointerface, the Li − S cell with MoS2-x-Co9S8-y/rGO interlayer delivers high sulfur utilization (1382.5 mAh/g at 0.1C), excellent rate capability (710.2 mAh/g at 3C), and long cycle life over 600 cycles (0.06 % capacity decay per cycle). This work demonstrates the great potential of anion deficiency and heterojunction co-construction for high-performance Li − S batteries.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Efficient treatment of landfill leachate using an electrochemical ceramic membrane filtration system: Chlorine-mediated oxidation,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Efficient removal of contaminants from landfill leachate remains to be a major challenge, calling for novel technologies for advanced treatment of those high-salinity wastewaters. In this work, an iridium-decorated electrochemical ceramic membrane was fabricated via magnetron sputtering deposition for the treatment of landfill leachate. The electrochemical ceramic membrane filtration (ECMF) system achieved 70.8 ± 1.5 % of chemical oxygen demand (COD) and 31.7 ± 2.8 % of total nitrogen under hydraulic retention time (HRT) 60 min and membrane flux 50 L/(m2 h) during 14-d operation. Furthermore, the ratio of biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) to COD in the effluent was increased to 0.56 in comparison to that of the influent (0.24), indicating the increase in the biodegradability of the effluent. The reactive chlorine species generated in the system were mainly responsible for the pollutant removal in this system, efficiently oxidizing the humic substances and reducing the aromaticity of the contaminants. The energy consumption and current efficiency of the ECMF system were 49.3 kWh/ kg COD and 37.4 % at 20 mA cm−2, respectively. The results of this study highlight the potential of using the ECMF system for efficient treatment of high-salinity wastewater.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Wide-pH-compatible MoSx co-catalyst layer on TiO2 nanowire arrays photoanode for simultaneous acceleration of charge carrier separation and catalytic reactions,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.The water oxidation reaction is a key reaction for solar water splitting, which requires excellent oxygen evolution co-catalyst to accelerate charges separation efficiency and high catalytic reaction sites for O2 releasing. So far, many earth-abundant co-catalysts can only play roles at a single pH (only in neutral or alkaline electrolyte), but the development of wide-pH compatible co-catalyst with low price are rarely obtained. Herein, amorphous MoSx layer was conformally coated on TiO2 nanowire arrays (NAs) as an active co-catalyst for multi-pH water photo-oxidation. The experimental results showed that the MoSx greatly enhanced the photoelectrochemical (PEC) performance of TiO2 NAs with high photocurrent densities of 1.95, 1.67, and 1.55 mA/cm2 at 1.23 VRHE in acidic, alkaline, and neutral electrolyte, respectively, significantly higher than bare TiO2 and most TiO2/co-catalyst literature values. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that the MoSx on TiO2 improves electronic interaction at their interface and forms a type-II band structure for more efficient separation of charge carriers. It is also found that high-density active sites provided by MoSx can reduce the Gibbs free energy and overpotential of potential-determining step for OER, which further enhance the adsorption activity of reaction intermediates. Our work contributes to the in-depth understanding of amorphous MoSx as efficient water oxidation co-catalyst for multi-pH PEC water splitting.",Chemical Engineering Journal
"Facile synthesis of hierarchical Ti3C2@FeOOH nanocomposites for antimony contaminated wastewater treatment: Performance, mechanisms, reutilization, and sustainability","© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Designing well-behaved nanocomposites for adsorbing and removing heavy metals has been the top strategies in wastewater treatment. Herein, we report a MXene-based hierarchical nanocomposite via in-situ growth of ferric oxides (FeOOH) on the alkali Ti3C2 for efficient immobilization of Sb(III) and Sb(V) from aqueous solution. The alkalized MXene with negatively charged surface allows the formation of stable heterojunction structure between Ti3C2 and FeOOH through electrostatic self-assembly, resulting in uniformly distributed FeOOH nanoparticles onto Ti3C2 nanosheets. The Ti3C2@FeOOH nanocomposite exhibits maximum adsorption capacities at 111.50 and 93.22 mg/g for Sb(III) and Sb(V), respectively, outperforming majority of metallic-based adsorbents. DFT calculations reveal that the binding energy between Ti3C2@FeOOH and Sb(III) is higher than that of Sb(V), which agree well with the experimental results. The combination of inner-sphere complexation and electrostatic attraction are the dominant forces responsible for the removal of Sb species according to microanalysis. Moreover, the as-prepared nanocomposite presents potential applications in treating antimony contaminated wastewater with high reusability and sustainability. Interestingly, the Ti3C2@FeOOH after loading with Sb species can serve as potential electrode materials, thereby minimizing secondary pollution of waste adsorbents to the environment. This work opens new avenues for function tailoring of nano-multilayered composites towards remediation of heavy metals from water media.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Enhancing the electronic metal-support interaction of CoRu alloy and pyridinic N for electrocatalytic pH-universal hydrogen evolution reaction,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.The construction of efficient pH-universal hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) electrocatalysts remain enormous challenges for hydrogen production from water electrolysis. Herein, we reported a HER electrocatalyst composed of cobalt-ruthenium alloy nanoparticles with the synergy of pyridinic N (CoRu/NC-700). CoRu/NC-700 exhibits excellent HER performance and stability in acidic, alkaline and neutral media, and can reach 10 mA cm−2 with overpotential of only 6, 10 and 30 mV, respectively. Especially in alkaline and acidic media, overpotential of only 217 and 227 mV are required to achieve 1000 mA cm−2, respectively, which is of great significance for industrialized hydrogen produced by electrolysis of water. KSCN and H3PO4 poisoning experiments prove that such high HER activity is attributed to the synergistic enhancement effect of pyridinic N on CoRu nanoparticles. This work will lay the foundation for the designing and development of novel and efficient pH-universal HER electrocatalysts.",Chemical Engineering Journal
1D-2D hybridization: Nanoarchitectonics for grain boundary-rich platinum nanowires coupled with MXene nanosheets as efficient methanol oxidation electrocatalysts,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Although a direct methanol fuel cell with high energy utilization efficiency and low hazardous emission has broad application prospects in various energy-related fields, the insufficient methanol oxidation activity as well as the short service life of the anode catalysts continue to hinder its large-scale commercialization. Herein, we demonstrate a convenient and robust approach for the controllable synthesis of 1D grain boundary-rich Pt nanowires strongly coupled with ultrathin Ti3C2Tx MXene nanosheets (Pt NWs/MX). Such a unique architectural design endows the heterojunction catalysts with a series of structural merits, including large accessible surface area, stable interconnected Pt networks, numerous grain boundary sites, ameliorative electronic structure, and excellent electron conductivity. Consequently, the optimized Pt NWs/MX catalyst exhibits a unique methanol oxidation performance with a large electrochemically active surface area of 105.5 m2 g−1, a high mass (specific) activity of 1621.5 mA mg−1 (1.6 mA cm−2), as well as superior long-term durability, making it more competitive than conventional Pt nanoparticle/carbon catalysts with the same Pt loading.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Optimized Co–S bonds energy and confinement effect of hollow MXene@CoS2/NC for enhanced sodium storage kinetics and stability,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.The sluggish kinetics and severe volume expansion are two major drawbacks that limiting the application of transition metal sulfides electrode materials for sodium ion batteries (SIBs). Herein, we assembled Ti3C2Tx MXene nanosheets into thin-walled hollow spheres with PMMA spheres as sacrificial template, on which MOF-derived CoS2 nanoparticles embedded in N-doped carbon were grown (MXene@CoS2/NC). The MXene@CoS2/NC exhibits state-of-the-art sodium ion storage properties, including a high reversible capacity of 620 mAh g−1 at 0.2 A g−1, superior rate capability (394 mAh g−1 at 5 A g−1), and excellent cycling stability (355 mAh g−1 after 5000 cycles). The corresponding electrochemical tests prove that the MXene@CoS2/NC has fast Na+ ion diffusion and electron transfer compared with its counterpart without MXene interfaces. XPS and XANES characterizations disclose the introduced MXene and increased pyrrolic N can weaken the Co-S bonds of CoS2, which facilitates the conversion reaction between CoS2 and Na2S, and thus improves the sodium storage kinetics. The DFT calculations also demonstrate the MXene can improve the conductivity of electrode materials by fast interfacial electron transfer. In addition, the MXene hollow spheres and MOF-derived NC provide host structures for CoS2, which can increase the contact between electrolyte and active materials, buffer the volume expansion of CoS2, and thus enhancing the electrochemical stability. This work provides a feasible strategy to construct anode materials for SIBs with improved sodium storage kinetics and cycling stability.",Chemical Engineering Journal
A robust Ni@NCNT-C catalyst for highly efficient electrochemical CO2 reduction to CO over a wide potential range,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.The electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) to CO is regarded as a potential way to relieve CO2 level and produce value-added chemicals. However, most reported catalysts only possess high Faraday efficiency of CO (FECO%) under a narrow potential range, and this shortage largely limits its ultimate practical viability. Herein, we develop a facile method to synthesize nickel encased by nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes on carbon support (Ni@NCNT-C) catalyst for CO2RR. As for the important influence factors, the Ni content and treatment temperature are carefully controlled, and their influence on textural property and catalytic performance is investigated. The 0.1Ni@NCNT-C-800 catalyst provides a low overpotential (−0.27 V vs. RHE) and high FECO% (∼100%). The CO partial current density can reach 230 mA cm−2 and the activity can be maintained over 40 h. More importantly, a wide potential range of 900 mV (−0.27 V to − 1.17 V vs. RHE) can be obtained when FECO% is continuously maintained at nearly 100%. This work may provide a route to seek a robust catalyst for high-efficiency CO2RR over a wide potential range.",Chemical Engineering Journal
The PdHx metallene with vacancies for synergistically enhancing electrocatalytic N2 fixation,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.It is of great significance to controlled synthesis of high activity, selectivity and durable electrocatalysts. In this work, for the first time, the ultrathin (0.9 nm) of interstitial metallene with controlled vacancies and lattice hydrogen atoms are successfully gained. With the optimal lattice hydrogen atoms and composition, the interstitial VPd-PdH0.41 metallene exhibits the great nitrogen reduction (NRR) activity in Li2SO4 solution, among interstitial PdHx with different extent of vacancies, interstitial PdH0.41 without vacancies and Pd nansheets. The density functional theory (DFT), in situ Raman and Attenuated total reflection surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectrum (ATR-SEIRAS) tests further display that the VPd on the interstitial VPd-PdH0.41 metallene can urges the adsorption and arousal of N2, while lattice hydrogen atoms as active hydrogen source to follow an association mechanism rather than a dissociation mechanism, showing nice NRR performance at low overpotential.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Sulfur-doped unsaturated Ni-N3 coordination for efficient electroreduction of CO2,"© 2022Tuning coordination environment of metal atoms in catalysts can improve intrinsic performance of CO2 reduction and accelerate kinetics of CO formation. However, constructing unsaturated coordination configuration of metal single-atom by heteroatom doping still remains a challenge. Herein, a novel electrocatalyst of S/N co-coordinated Ni single-atom (denoted as Ni-SNC) was synthesized by calcining SO42- doped Zn/Ni ZIF for electrocatalytic CO2 reduction. The existence of single-atom Ni was verified by HAADF-STEM, while formation of “unsaturated” Ni-N3-S active sites was confirmed by XANES and EXAFS. The energy barrier of pivotal steps in CO2RR reaction process was reduced on “unsaturated” Ni-N3-S active sites, and sulfur doping improved current density of electrocatalytic process. The energy barrier of CO2→COOH* over Ni-SNC catalyst was only +0.69 eV, which was much less than that (+2.02 eV) over Ni-NC catalyst. The Ni-SNC exhibited CO Faradaic efficiency (FECO) of >90% at -0.6 ∼ -0.9 V vs. RHE with the highest FECO of 95% at −0.8 V.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Carbide-directed enhancement of electrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction on tungsten carbide–oxide heterostructure,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Carbide–oxide heterointerfaces have been known to be responsible for electrochemical activity, however, it is rarely investigated in tungsten carbide-oxide heterostructure for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Furthermore, typical carbide preparation includes carbonization of oxide under gaseous carbon sources at a high temperature, resulting in sintering and collapse of the heterostructures. In this work, nano-sized carbon dots (CDs, ∼2 nm in diameter) were adopted as carbon sources and dispersed on tungsten oxide nanorods allowing abundant nucleation sites for oxide-to-carbide conversion, resulting in high density of carbide-oxide heterointerfaces. The resulting tungsten carbide-oxide heterostructure decorated with carbon dots (WO(3−x) − WCy/CDs) exhibited superior electrocatalytic activity toward the HER with a low overpotential of 65 mV at a current density of − 10 mA cm−2 in acidic media. This performance is among the best electrocatalytic activities compared to the state-of-the-art tungsten carbide-based electrocatalysts. Importantly, the single-cell test using WO(3−x) − WCy/CDs as the cathode showed a current density of 10 mA cm−2 with a cell voltage of only 1.47 V, which is very close to that for Pt/C (1.41 V). In addition, a combined analysis of the X-ray spectroscopic and electrochemical results suggested an optimal W–C ratio in the tungsten carbide-oxide composite to guarantee the high HER activity. Theoretical calculations provided more insight into the carbide-directed enhancement of the electrocatalytic activity of WO(3−x) − WCy/CDs.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Electrochemical fabrication of polyaniline films deposited on graphene-loaded electrodes for •OH production and perfluorooctanoic acid degradation,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.The present study describes the coating of modified graphite felt (GF) with graphene (GE) and polyaniline (PANI). GF was doped with nitrogen atoms by a series of modification and electrolytic deposition. Tests of different types of N content and cathodic catalytic oxidation performance confirmed that the graphite N introduction promoted the production of H2O2 in the 2e- process. Pyridine N catalyzed the H2O2 decomposition to produce •OH. The amount of H2O2 produced by GF, GF-GE, and GF-GE@PANI system was 11 mg L-1, 70 mg L-1, and 180 mg L-1, respectively. The doping of graphene increased H2O2 yield, and the electrolytic deposition of PANI converted H2O2 to •OH rapidly. It was proved that the N atom provided by graphene was graphite N, which was the active catalytic site for the production of H2O2. The perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) removal at 180 min was 24.1% and 49.8% in the GF and GF-GE systems, respectively. The GF-GE@PANI system achieved 100% PFOA removal within 160 min. It was demonstrated that the enrichment of PANI with pyridine N provided many active sites for improving the conversion of H2O2 to •OH and in-situ degrading organic pollutants, offering an alternative for wastewater treatment.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Interfacial electron modulation of Cu2O by Co3O4 embedded in hollow carbon cube skeleton for boosting oxygen reduction/revolution reactions,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Copper (Cu) oxides with various oxidation states are known to be extremely active for oxygen reduction/evolution reactions (ORR/OER). Here, Cu2O-based composites by combining with Co3O4 are designed as non-noble catalysts for ORR/OER by using density-functional-theory (DFT) calculations. Cu-sites in Cu2O-Co3O4 (1 1 1) structure are the main active-sites for ORR/OER, which can obtain desirable interfacial charge transfer through favorable energy band arrangements. As inspired by calculation results, Cu2O nanoparticles (20–30 nm) coated on hollow zeolitic imidazolate framework-67 (ZIF-67)-derived nitrogen (N)-doped carbon-cube (HZCNC) with skeleton Co3O4 are prepared as a hollowly-wrapped structure (Cu2O/HZCNC) for boosting ORR/OER, which makes it have the fast electron/mass transfer characteristics. Catalyst marked as Cu2O/HZCNC-0.425 (mass ratio of copper chloride to HZCNC is 0.425) exhibits better ORR activity (E1/2 of 0.90 V) and methanol tolerance than Pt/C, a lower overpotential (350 mV) than RuO2 for OER, and a stable cell voltage gap (0.941 V, average) in a primary zinc-air battery even after 200 h. As indicated by density functional theory results, Cu2O can energetically supply the electrons to the closely-contacted HZCNC (Co3O4) to enhance ORR/OER activities and stabilities. It highlights the excellent functions of Cu-oxides in oxygen electrocatalysis, and provides new insights for development of highly-efficient electrocatalysts with hollow structure.",Chemical Engineering Journal
A novel insight into deterioration of heavily sulfur-loaded cathode in Li-S battery,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdActive-substance (S8 and Li2S) deposition layer formed on polar interfaces is more reactive than that formed on apolar interfaces. However, when deposition layer reaches a certain thickness, by-path active-substance deposition takes place because of polysulfide disproportionation, which aggravates active-substance segregation to decrease the reactivity. This leads to a significant capacity decay and failure to accomplish polysulfide delithiation after certain cycles, which is understood as the results of decreased active-substance utilization and formed local micro-short-circuits, respectively. The finding of correlation between active-substance segregation and cathode deterioration inspires the design of polytetrafluoroethylene-based self-supported cathode to suppress active-substance segregation through avoiding increase of interphase contact resistance during cycling. With S-loading of 4.0 mg cm−2, the as-prepared cathode demonstrates excellent cycleability, retaining a capacity of 300 mAh g−1 at a rate of 2C after 1000 cycles. When increasing S-loading up to 36.5 mg cm−2, the as-obtained cathode delivers an ultra-high areal capacity of 24.6 mAh cm−2 after 100 cycles at 0.1 C. However, increasing S-loading aggravates Li2S segregation which then narrows down Li+ transportation, leading to formation and growth of Li-shunts which in turn stimulates active-substance segregation. Such an inductive interaction between Li-shunt growth and active-substance segregation results in the fast formation of local micro-short-circuits, causing the constant supply of Li from Li shunts to cathode, and eventually accelerating cathode deterioration.",Electrochimica Acta
Using coupled Ni and Zn oxides based on ZIF8 as efficient electrocatalyst for OER,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdIn the present work, we report the synthesis and characterization of efficient and stable electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline medium constructed using Ni and/or Co oxides dispersed on Zn oxide based on the zeolitic imidazole framework (ZIF8) operated through a combined application of solvothermal and calcination methods. Once subjected to calcination, the calcined, solvothermally treated Ni/ZIF8, named Ni/ZIF8-900A composite, recorded the most impressive improvement in OER electrocatalytic activity among the electrocatalysts synthesized in this study. Ni/ZIF8-900A recorded an overpotential (η) of 0.34 V at 10 mA cm−2; this was the same value obtained for RuO2 and was relatively close to the value obtained for IrO2 (0.29 V) - both widely regarded as state-of-the-art electrocatalysts. Long-term electrochemical tests revealed that Ni/ZIF8-900A had a negligible loss in electrocatalytic activity, demonstrating its high electrocatalytic efficiency in OER in alkaline medium. The physicochemical characterization of the Ni/ZIF8-900A composite showed that the catalyst is characterized by overlapping and merged structures of ZnO and Ni0.8Zn0.2O, as well as a high Ni content on its surface (Ni(1):Zn(2) in %w/w) in comparison with the Ni content in the bulk composition (Ni(1):Zn(14) in %w/w). The large amount of Ni3+ on the Ni/ZIF8-900A surface (before and after the stability tests) and the presence of N atoms bonded to the metals were found to be responsible for the improved OER activity of the electrocatalyst. The electrochemical results showed that when exposed to oxidative potentials during OER experiments, the surface structure of the Ni oxide/oxyhydroxide-enriched Ni/ZIF8-900A catalyst is activated. The outstanding OER electroactivity of the Ni/ZIF8-900A composite can be attributed to surface activation fueled by oxide formation, which resulted in an increase in active surface area along the composite and caused a possible displacement of Ni3+ states to Ni4+ states on the oxides formed.",Electrochimica Acta
"‘Switch to love, switch to kill—dose and light co-regulate iron single-atom nanozyme to modulate cell fate","© 2022 IOP Publishing Ltd.Remote control of cells and the regulation of cell events at the molecular level are of great interest to the biomedical field. In addition to mechanical forces and genes, chemical compounds and light play pivotal roles in regulating cell fate, which have boosted the fast growth of biology. Herein, we synthesized light-regulated, atomically dispersed Fe-N4 immobilized on a carbon substrate nanozyme (Fe-N/C single atom catalysts), whose peroxidase- and catalase-like properties can be enhanced by 120% and 135%, respectively, under 808-nm laser irradiation through the photothermal effect of Fe-N/C. Interestingly, a switch to love/switch to kill interaction between Fe-N/C dose and near-infrared (NIR) light co-regulating the Fe-N/C nanozyme to modulate cell fate was discovered. Based on this, we found that under NIR light irradiation, when the dose of Fe-N/C is low, it can scavenge more reactive oxygen species (ROS) and achieve cell protection; when the dose of Fe-N/C is too high, it tended to lead to cell apoptosis. This work not only provides an effective strategy for the regulation of nanozyme activity but also realizes the dual-functional application of nanozyme materials for the treatment of some specific diseases.",Nanotechnology

First-principles calculation on effects of oxygen vacancy on α-MnO2 and β-MnO2 during oxygen reduction reaction for rechargeable metal-air batteries,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.MnO2 is widely applied as oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) electrocatalysts in different metal-air batteries (MABs). Enhancing the ORR activity of MnO2-based catalysts is necessary for improving the performance of MABs. Defect-engineering of catalyst materials is a key approach for enabling the high performance of ORR. Here, the defect-engineering of α-MnO2 (211) and β-MnO2 (110) by oxygen vacancy (OV) is investigated using the first-principles density functional theory calculation. The geometric structure, adsorption, electronic conductivity, and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity are studied. As a result, the OV induces the geometric structure that the Mn–Mn and Mn–O distances are closer when the catalysts lose the oxygen atom(s) on the top-layer surfaces. The presence of OV not only enhances the adsorption energy of *OOH, *O, and *OH, but also increases the electronic conductivity analyzed via the electron transfer. The Bader charge analysis demonstrates that the Mn(IV) can be altered to Mn(III) by the electron accumulation from OV. The volcano plot of ORR overpotential indicates that having the excess OV concentration on MnO2 surfaces cannot enhance the ORR activity. The excellent activity is yielded by 12.50 % OV α-(211) and 66.66 % OV β-(110) with the ORR overpotential of 0.31 V and 0.60 V, respectively. The results demonstrate that Ov is an essential parameter defining the existence of Mn(III) and Mn(IV) on the surface of MnO2-based catalysts. The optimal ratio of Mn(IV):Mn(III) is in challenge developing the α-MnO2 and β-MnO2 electrocatalyst cathode for metal-air batteries. This study provides a guideline for developing the potential cathode catalyst for MABs, used for harvesting energy.",Journal of Alloys and Compounds
Novel FeNi-FeCo-C composite nanofibers: Highly efficient electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution from water splitting,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.The development of a facile strategy to fabricate inexpensive and efficient nonnoble metal-based alloys to replace their traditionally costly noble-metal counterparts for electrocatalytic water splitting holds great appeal. Here, we report novel FeNi-FeCo-C composite nanofibers (FeNi-FeCo-C CNFs), which was prepared simply by electrospinning a precursor solution containing Fe, Ni and Co nitrates together with polyacrylonitrile powders and subsequent thermal treatment.

Heterogeneous cobalt-iron phosphide nanosheets formed by in situ phosphating of hydroxide for efficient overall water splitting,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Transition metal phosphides (TMPs) have emerged as one of the most promising electrocatalysts toward water decomposition because of exceptional catalytic properties and abundant reserves. Herein, we successfully construct an unique CoP3/Fe2P nanosheet catalyst grown on Ni foam (CoP3/Fe2P@NF NSs) via a successive solvothermal-phosphating strategy for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). It should be emphasized that abundant heterointerfaces and lots of nanopores are formed by in-situ phosphating CoFe layered double hydroxides (CoFe-LDHs) precursor. Specifically, the redistribution of electrons at heterogeneous interfaces provides more active sites for reactant molecules or intermediates, and abundant nanopores on the nanosheets facilitate escape of resulting gas, thus releasing active sites in time. Density functional theory (DFT) calculation also proves that CoP3-Fe2P heterointerfaces can further optimize hydrogen adsorption energy (ΔGH*) to effectively reduce free energy barrier. Thus, the CoP3/Fe2P@NF-2 catalyst presents extraordinary electrocatalytic performance towards HER and OER with overpotentials of 81 mV and 236 mV at 10 mA cm−2. As an encouraging result, it provides a low voltage of 1.53 V at 20 mA cm−2 and satisfactory cycling stabilization of over 28 h, comparable to most reported catalysts. This work affords a promising approach for synthesis of binary and above transition metal phosphides.",Journal of Alloys and Compounds

Unlike Ta2Ni3S8 in the orthorhombic phase, which is known to have semiconductor properties, Ta2Ni3S8 in the tetragonal phase displayed metallic material properties. Structural analysis through X-ray diffraction confirmed that the tetragonal Ta2Ni3S8 (T-Ta2Ni3S8) had the same structure as the tetragonal Ta2Ni3Se8 (T-Ta2Ni3Se8), a material with an S- and Se- substitution; the only difference was the lattice constant. Additionally, different elemental analyses were used to confirm that the ratio of Ta:Ni:S elements was 2:3:8.

Benefiting from the suitable N-doping degree inherited from polyaniline, and the hierarchical porous structure originated from the synergistic adjustment of self-sacrificial template and activation treatment, PDHC exhibits significant advantages for electrochemical energy storage. Typically, the PDHC has the high specific capacitance (467 F g−1 at 1 A g−1) and rate performance (71.9% capacitance retention at 20 A g−1) in three-electrode systems. PDHC-based coin type symmetric supercapacitors are assembled with 1 M H2SO4 electrolytes and ionic liquid electrolytes, respectively, and they all exhibit a considerable synergistic power-energy output (752 W kg−1 at 31.1 Wh kg−1 and 750 W kg−1 at 74.8 Wh kg−1) and an acceptable cycling stability (6.5% and 13.9% loss over 5000 cycles).

Structural engineering of CoMoO3 nanosheets on cage-like carbon nanoflakes toward enhanced lithium storage performance,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Bimetal oxides possess high electronic conductivity and multiple electrochemically active sites owing to their stepwise electrochemical reactions compared with the single metal oxides. However, bimetal oxides still suffer from the severe volume changes upon lithium insertion/delithiation processes, thus leading to poor cycle stability. Herein, we demonstrate the growth of novel CoMoO3 nanosheets on the cage-like carbon nanoflakes (c-CNFs) through a facile in-situ thermal decomposition strategy. The phase and morphology structures of CoMoO3 can be readily controlled by adjusting the sintering temperature under the argon atmosphere, changing from 0D CoMoO4 nanoparticles@c-CNFs (350 ℃, denoted as CoMoO4 @C) to 0D CoMoO4 nanoparticles and 2D CoMoO3 nanosheets co-existed nanohybrids@c-CNFs (450 ℃, denoted as CoMoOx @C) and 2D CoMoO3 nanosheets@c-CNFs (550 ℃, denoted as CoMoO3 @C). When examined as anode materials for LIBs, the CoMoO3 @C electrode exhibited excellent lithium storage performance. The superior performance of the CoMoO3 @C electrode could be attributed to the novel CoMoO3 nanosheet structure combined with the reduced volume change from well-fitted CoMoO3 @c-CNFs, which delivered a reversible capacity of ~706 mA h/g for 360 cycles at 500 mA/g, higher than that of the CoMoO4 @C and CoMoOx @C electrodes.",Journal of Alloys and Compounds
Effects of Sn-containing intermetallic compounds on the thermal decomposition and ignition properties of RDX and TKX-50,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.In order to develop efficient combustion catalysts for solid propellants, three intermetallic compounds of Sn-Cu, Sn-Co and Sn-Ni were synthesized by a hydrothermal method and their effects on the thermal decomposition and ignition properties of 1,3,5-trinitroperhy-dro-1,3,5-triazine (RDX) and 5,5′-bistetrazole-1,1′-diolate (TKX-50) were studied systemically. The results show that Sn-Cu, Sn-Co and Sn-Ni can all promote the thermal decomposition of RDX, which reduce the exothermic decomposition peak temperature of RDX by 3.2, 1.9 and 4.8 ℃, respectively. And the apparent activation energy of RDX was reduced by 82.1 kJ·mol−1 after adding the Sn-Ni intermetallic compound. In comparison with RDX, the exothermic peak temperature of TKX-50 was reduced more significantly, which was decreased by 11.9, 1.5 and 6.6 ℃ in the existence of Sn-Cu, Sn-Co and Sn-Ni, respectively. Additionally, Sn-containing intermetallic compound could reduce the ignition delay time of RDX under high power laser density, while the ignition delay time of TKX-50 could be decreased in the full power density range of the experiment. Besides, the flame combustion intensity and propagation rate of RDX and TKX-50 were significantly heightened by adding the three compounds. The comparison of pyrolysis and ignition performance before and after adding Sn-containing intermetallic compound into RDX and TKX-50 shows that Sn-containing intermetallic compound has great application prospects for improving the heat release and combustion characteristic of solid propellants.",Journal of Alloys and Compounds

In this study, a new electrode with ferrocene-based coordination compounds supported by nickel foam was designed and prepared, in which the coordination compounds are assembled by cobalt chloride and 1, 1'-ferrocenedicarboxylic acid.

During the catalytic process, the metal-organic framework surface shows an obvious phase evolution behavior. The synergetic effect between Co and Fe sites, and the unique microstructure of the in situ derived active species are believed to be responsible for the excellent electrocatalytic performance. The catalytic electrode was also investigated as a cathode in a Zn-air battery, which presents an energy density of 572 mW h gZn−1, a peak power density of 60 mW cm−2, and an excellent cyclability of over 50 h.

Hierarchical LDH-MOF derived NiCo-bimetallic phosphide (NiCo-MOF-P) has been tested for methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) in alkaline solution. Electrodeposited NiCo-LDH gives extra chemical and structural stability for MOF to avoid accumulation.

Facile synthesis of mesoporous carbon materials with a three-dimensional ordered mesostructure and rich FeNX/C-S-C sites for efficient electrocatalytic oxygen reduction,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Incorporation of sulfur (S) atoms into iron/nitrogen co-doped (FeNX) carbon materials is attractive for developing efficient electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Synthesis of such materials with suitable pore structures and rich active sites are important to improve the ORR performance. In this study, we demonstrate the facile synthesis of novel N/S co-doped ordered mesoporous carbon materials with a three-dimensional (3D) ordered bicontinuous cubic mesopore structure and rich FeNX and carbon-sulfur-carbon (C-S-C) sites (denoted as FeNX@NSOMCs) using the solvent-free nanocasting method. The 3D ordered bicontinuous cubic mesopore structure is replicated in the FeNX@NSOMCs from the mesoporous silica hard template KIT-6. The uniform N/S dopants in the carbon matrix is derived from the confined pyrolysis of a single amino acid methionine (Met). The creation of the FeNX sites is enabled by using anhydrous FeCl3 as the precursor. The absence of solvent and the coordination between FeCl3 and Met can reduce metal hydrolysis and aggregation, reduce N loss, and thus promote the formation of FeNX sites. The FeNX@NSOMCs possess high surface areas (830–938 m2/g), large pore volumes (0.97–1.36 cm3/g), disordered macropores and ordered mesopores (3.5–3.6 nm), and well-graphitized carbon walls. They are promising for ORR. The represent sample shows superior performance under alkaline conditions, achieving a high half-wave potential of 0.9 V, a high kinetic current density of 4.2 mA/cm2, a low Tafel slope of 55.3 mV/dec, a near four-electron process with a low H2O2 yield and a high stability.

Herein, we report novel Fe3SnC and Sn nanoparticles anchored on N-doped carbon matrix (denoted as Fe-Sn@NC) as an efficient electrocatalyst for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Owing to the simultaneous incorporation of Fe and Sn (metal loading up to 31 wt%), Fe-Sn@NC shows higher total N content, pyridinic N content, and electronic interaction between Fe and Sn compared with its single metal counterparts. Therefore, Fe-Sn@NC catalysts achieve half-wave potentials (E1/2) > 0.89 V vs. RHE and kinetic current densities > 4.1 mA cm−2 at 0.90 V vs. RHE. Apart from that, Fe-Sn@NC demonstrates fast mass transport as well as oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity.

A mild and effective photo-catalytic protocol for triggering inert nitrous oxide to participate in oxidative dehydrogenation of alcohols under visible light illumination,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.The development of a mild and efficient activation protocol for the nitrous oxide (N2O)-based selective oxidation has very important academic and applied values in the harmless treatment and high value-added utilization of N2O. This paper discloses that decatungstate (DT) anion and especially its hybrids with metal ions (1%M-DTs) are active for the N2O-involved oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of cyclohexanol in MeCN under visible light illumination. The best 1%Cu-DT achieves ca. 46.3% cyclohexanone yield and its turnover frequency (TOF) is up to 6.56 h-1 at high substrate concentration (1 M). Also, 1%Cu-DT is efficient for the N2O-involved ODH reactions of aliphatic and especially aromatic primary/secondary alcohols. UV–vis spectra, the isotope tracing tests of H218O and DFT calculations support that the double-reduced H2DT species in situ-generated during the photo- reaction may turn into its oxygen-vacant state through dehydration, which the latter plays a crucial role in the oxygen transfer from N2O to it.",Applied Catalysis B: Environmental
In situ electrochemical characterization of CuxO-based gas-diffusion electrodes (GDEs) for CO2 electrocatalytic reduction in presence and absence of liquid electrolyte and relationship with C2+ products formation,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Copper oxide-based gas-diffusion electrodes (CuxO/GDEs) for CO2 electrocatalytic reduction are investigated in presence and absence of liquid electrolyte (liquid- and gas-phase operations) in terms of (i) catalytic reactivity in compact-design flow cells (with the electrodes located on the two sides of a Nafion membrane) and (ii) in situ electrochemical characterization by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), cyclic voltammetry (CV) and chronoamperometry (CA). On the same electrocatalyst, the adoption of liquid- or gas-phase operations induces significant changes in the catalytic behaviour with formation of C2+ chemicals observed only in gas-phase. Parallel tests by EIS, complemented by CV and CA measurements, evidence that the catalytic properties of these electrodes, and in turn the selectivity paths, are largely determined by transport limitations rather than only by the intrinsic properties of the electrocatalysts. The EIS technique, used here for the first time to compare liquid- and gas-phase operations, has proved to be a strategic tool, providing insights into the critical factors needed to optimize performance beyond the properties of the electrocatalysts themselves.",Applied Catalysis B: Environmental

To this end, the design and development of active and robust electrocatalysts is key. Here we report for the first time that incorporation of bismuth (Bi) single atoms on defective CuO could significantly enhance the ECR reaction to C2H4 by decreasing C–C coupling barriers. The overpotential for C2H4 production is lowered by at least 50 mV, along with a two-fold improvement in the faradaic efficiency, reaching 60% at 400 mA cm−2. The high performance is maintained even after 20 h of consecutive electrolysis. Control experiments along with density functional theory calculations suggest that the joint incorporation of Bi and oxygen vacancies greatly promotes CO2 adsorption and lowers C–C coupling energy barriers, thereby improving the C2H4 selectivity.",Applied Catalysis B: Environmental
Mediating heterogenized nickel phthalocyanine into isolated Ni-N3 moiety for improving activity and stability of electrocatalytic CO2 reduction,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.The poor stability of heterogenized nickel phthalocyanine (NiPc) has hindered its application as a desirable catalyst for electrocatalytic carbon dioxide reduction. Herein, the electrocatalytic stability of heterogenized NiPc on nitrogen-doped hollow carbon nanospheres (NiPc@NHCSs) can be optimized via mediating NiPc into Ni-NC moiety (Ni-NC/NHCSs-Y) to construct a stable Ni catalytic unit. Different from the poor activity of NiPc@NHCSs (CO Faradaic efficiency, FECO< 80%, stability < 1200 s), the optimal catalyst (Ni-NC/NHCSs-600) with unsaturated Ni-N3 nitrogen-vacancy structure, displays FECO of 98.57% and CO turnover frequency of 3.75 s−1 at − 0.87 V vs. RHE, and stable operation over 14 h (−0.82 V vs. RHE). The stabilization mechanism and the temperature effect on the structure-activity relationship are systematically explored, which successfully steers the design of stable Ni-NC catalytic unit on different carbon substrate, while a zinc-CO2 rechargeable battery is constructed, displaying a peak power density of 0.64 mW cm−2 and FECO of 91.45%.",Applied Catalysis B: Environmental
A novel Ni-Co alloy catalyst derived from spinel,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.In this work, five Ni-Co alloy catalysts (NiCo2-N, NiCo2-200, NiCo2-350, NiCo2-500, NiCo2-700) were prepared by the reduction of precursors, which came from different calcination temperatures. The catalyst characterization suggested that all these catalysts had different alloy structures. No calcination or calcination temperatures lower than 200 °C would generate Ni-Co alloy prone to collapse. However, catalysts would possess solid structures when these precursors were calcinated at 350, 500, or 700 °C. Moreover, the calcination temperature significantly affected the surface Ni/Co compositions on these catalysts and the H2 adsorption and activation capabilities of these Ni-Co alloy catalysts. Finally, when using benzene hydrogenation as a probe reaction, the catalyst activities were evaluated, and it's observed that NiCo2-350 catalyst, not only having a uniform Ni-Co alloy structure but pore structure on the surface of spherical particles, demonstrated the highest activity for benzene hydrogenation.",Journal of Alloys and Compounds
Synergistic interface engineering and structural optimization of non-noble metal telluride-nitride electrocatalysts for sustainably overall seawater electrolysis,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Searching for ideal candidates with high electrocatalytic performance for both HER and OER is a major objective to realize the large-scale H2 production by seawater electrolysis. Herein, we report delicate, heterostructured NiTe-NiCoN and NiTe-NiFeN electrocatalysts, which exhibit outstanding HER and OER performance, respectively. Impressively, the NiTe-NiCoN || NiTe-NiFeN couples in alkaline seawater solution delivered 400 mA cm−2 at 1.84 V along with long-term stability. Further analysis has revealed that not only heterogeneous interface engineering ensures exposure of abundant active sites and faster electron-mass transfer, but also induces electron modulation that optimizes the absorption/desorption for the reaction intermediates to enhanced the intrinsic activity. Notably, a high electric field intensity generated by the nanosheet-nanorod structure induces a local “hydroxide enrichment” environment that promotes the OER kinetics. This work shed lights on these novel heterostructured electrocatalysts with strong synergy, while demonstrating the key role of the unique nanostructures in high-efficiency seawater electrolysis.",Applied Catalysis B: Environmental
Stacking surface derived catalytic capability and by-product prevention for high efficient two dimensional Bi2Te3 cathode catalyst in Li-oxygen batteries,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Various two-dimensional (2D) structures cause different catalytic anisotropy based on the stack layers in Li-oxygen batteries (LOBs). Clarify the key factor for catalytic performance of 2D materials in LOBs is necessary. In this study, 2D structured Bi2Te3 with five Te-Bi atom layers in its stack layers is applied as the cathode catalyst for LOBs. Hexagonal nanodisks and roller-like nanoparticles are prepared for exposed controlling crystal plane by simple one-step hydrothermal method. It reveals the stack surface (001) plane can provide outstanding catalytic capability with high conductivity after the adsorption of discharge products and efficient pathway for the conversion from LiO2 to Li2O2 and prevent the formation of by-products. As consequence, a superior specific capacity of 21,172 mAh g−1 and high cycling stability of 188 cycles at 500 mA g−1 are achieved. The corresponding catalytic mechanism of Bi2Te3 mainly originates from its stack surface derived homogenous electronic state and high conductivity.",Applied Catalysis B: Environmental
"Efficient synthesis of the liquid fuel 2,5-dimethylfuran from biomass derived 5-(chloromethyl)furfural at room temperature","© 2022 Elsevier B.V.The synthesis of renewable transportation fuel 2,5-dimethylfuran (DMF) from biomass is a promising solution for efficient alleviating the dependence on the petroleum-derived commodities. Here, we found that in-situ generation of acidic species and Pd-Cl active sites bring high selectivity and activity towards hydrogenolysis of biomass-derived 5-(chloromethyl)furfural (CMF) to DMF. Gratifyingly, 92% DMF yield was achieved from CMF for 15 min, which indicates that space-time-yield is at least one order of magnitude higher than previous literature employed 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) as substrate. Kinetic studies showed that the in-situ formed acid has ignorable negative effect on polymerization of substrate to humins. DFT explicitly elucidate that the decorated Pd nanoparticles by Cl species provided lower adsorption energy and energy of C-O cleavage than Pd sites. Furthermore, the strategy of in-situ formation of homogeneous acid and halogen-modified metal is also efficient for catalytic conversion of other chlorinated carboxides to hydrocarbons with the ring intact.",Applied Catalysis B: Environmental
Single site Co-S anchored on carbon nitride as a highly active cocatalyst for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution,"© 2022The low utilization rate of photo-generated carriers in graphite-phase carbon nitride (g-C3N4) is the main factor limiting its photocatalytic performance. In this work, to begin with single-atom Co was inserted into the structure of g-C3N4, then it was vulcanized to prepare composite Co-S single-site in g-C3N4. The results show that the Co-S single-site cocatalyst was successfully synthesized and was stably anchored in the structure of g-C3N4. As an active site, it can not only enhance the reaction activity, but also capture electrons to provide transfer channels for the photo-generated carrier, thereby enhancing the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution performance of g-C3N4. The hydrogen production of Co-S single-site modified g-C3N4 reaches 72.85 μmol (per 0.02 g photocatalyst) under visible light, which is 9 times higher than that of pure g-C3N4. This work provides a reasonable method for the preparation of composite single-site cocatalyst.",Journal of Alloys and Compounds
Self-supported cobalt/cobalt selenide heterojunction for highly efficient overall water splitting,"© 2022Electrocatalytic water splitting is a vastly reliable method for hydrogen production. Nonetheless, its wide practical application urgently requires the development of highly active and stable bifunctional electrocatalysts with self-supported structures. This paper reports on a novel, simple way to fabricate an efficient cobalt/cobalt selenide (CS) catalytic electrode with a unique 3-D finger-like structure. More specifically, porous Co substrate was fabricated by a phase-inversion tape-casting and sintering method, followed by one-step selenization in Ar atmosphere. The resultant CS electrode manifested superior catalytic performance in both HER and OER (hydrogen and oxygen evolution reaction, respectively) that took place in an alkaline medium, with low overpotential and high long-term stability. Furthermore, the electrolysis test for overall water splitting was successfully performed by assembling the CS electrodes as both anode and cathode. The excellent electrocatalytic performance is ascribed to the high conductivity of the Co substrate, the distinctive finger-like structure, and the numerous in-situ developed heterojunctions, which suitably adjust the electronic structure and decrease the energy barrier of water splitting. Moreover, the density function theory (DFT) calculations revealed that the heterojunction enhances the density of the state near the Fermi level and optimize the kinetics of HER and OER processes. As a result, the hydrogen adsorption free energy (ΔGH*) is close to zero, and the energy barrier of the rate-determining step of OER is low due to the heterojunction formed.",Journal of Alloys and Compounds
Construction of rGO-coupled C3N4/C3N5 2D/2D Z-scheme heterojunction to accelerate charge separation for efficient visible light H2 evolution,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.As a fascinating two-dimensional (2D) conjugated polymer, graphitic carbon nitride (C3N4) has drawn broad attention as metal-free photocatalyst, but it's further utilization is confined by the limited visible light harvesting and severe charge recombination. Herein, N-rich carbon nitride (C3N5) with an azo-linked two s-heptazine units, different from C3N4 with a tertiary N-atom linked three s-heptazines, is prepared for constructing a novel sandwich heterojunction composed of reduced graphene oxide (rGO)-coupled C3N5 and C3N4. The introduced rGO in C3N4/rGO/C3N5 heterojunction can accelerate the interfacial charge separation and promote a rGO-mediated solid-state Z-scheme mechanism with an obvious synergistic effect, whereby C3N4 and C3N5 serve as electron-rich and hole-rich reservoirs, respectively. The resultant 2D/2D heterojunction delivers efficient visible-light-responsive activity with H2 evolution rate of 319 μmol h−1, 5.6 and 2.7 times higher than that of C3N4 and C3N5 alone, respectively.

Ultrathin NiFe-LDH nanosheets strongly coupled with MOFs-derived hybrid carbon nanoflake arrays as a self-supporting bifunctional electrocatalyst for flexible solid Zn-air batteries,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.The construction of a hybrid hierarchical architecture is a promising strategy for optimizing the electrocatalytic activity and the performance of flexible Zn-air battery. However, it still remains a challenging task. This study reports on the use of a simple approach in the preparation of a flexible 3D self-supporting bifunctional catalyst. Ultrathin NiFe-based layered double hydroxide nanosheets (NiFe-LDH) have in this approach been strongly coupled to a metal-organic framework (MOF)-derived carbon nanoflake array, to be used in flexible Zn-air batteries. Importantly, the introduction of Co nanoparticles that were anchored onto the nitrogen-doped porous carbon (Co-NC) nanoflakes provided an abundance of active sites for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Moreover, the catalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) process was improved by altering the local electronic structure of the Ni and Fe species in NiFe-LDH. The 3D interconnected conductive network structure, in addition to the strong coupling between NiFe-LDH and Co-NC, was found to give a catalyst with superior electrocatalytic OER performances. The overpotential was only 284 mV at 50 mA cm−2 in an alkaline medium, which is a result that outperforms the commercial RuO2 catalyst. This bifunctional catalyst did also exhibit a good catalytic performance that is comparable to that of commercial Pt/C towards ORR. Interestingly, when this catalyst was used as binder-free air cathode, the assembled flexible solid-state Zn-air battery demonstrated a favorable power density, cycling stability, and mechanical flexibility. The present work offers a facile and efficient strategy for the development and construction of self-supporting bifunctional OER/ORR electrocatalysts, to be used in wearable and flexible electronic devices.",Journal of Alloys and Compounds
Noble-metal-free Co-N-graphene/PDI for significant enhancement of photocatalytic performance,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Single-atom based photocatalysts have been widely used in the degradation of organic pollutants due to their excellent activity, nearly 100 % atomic utilization efficiency and well-defined active centers. Here, we propose a single Co atom cocatalyst coordinated by nitrogen-doped graphene (Co-NG) to enhance the photocatalytic activity of perylene diimide (PDI) toward bisphenol A (BPA) degradation. Firstly, the self-assembled PDI on the surface of Co-NG exhibits a uniform dispersion state, which facilitates electron transport across the interface. Secondly, Nitrogen-doped graphene can act as a charge transfer bridge to facilitate charge migration from PDI to single Co atom catalytic center. Therefore, in the photocatalytic degradation of BPA, the Co-NG/PDI composite photocatalyst showed a significant increase in activity. 7 % Co-NG/PDI composite possesses the best photocatalytic performance, and the apparent rate is 6.64 times and 7.6 times higher than those of self-assembled PDI and Co-NG. The excellent activity is due to its high photogenerated carrier migration and transfer efficiency. Furthermore, the results of free radical capture experiment and ESR test confirm that singlet oxygen, superoxide radical, hydroxyl radical and hole are the main active species in the degradation process of BPA. We detected the intermediate products and proposed the degradation by LC-MS analysis. This study may provide a promising sunlight-driven photocatalyst for the treatment of the BPA in wastewater.",Journal of Alloys and Compounds
Interfacial polarization in metal-organic framework reconstructed Cu/Pd/CuOx multi-phase heterostructures for electrocatalytic nitrate reduction to ammonia,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Electrochemical reduction of nitrate wastewater to high value-added ammonia is of significance to promote the restoration of ecosystem nitrogen cycle imbalances, which requires highly active and selective catalysts.

It is demonstrated that the CuPd-MOF precatalyst is in-situ reconstituted to Cu/Pd/CuOx multi-phase heterostructures as the actual catalytic active material under electrocatalysis operating conditions. Multi-phase heterogeneous interface between Cu, Pd and CuOx can trigger uneven spatial charge distribution for enhancing interface polarization and result in electron transfer from Pd to Cu, which promoting NO3- adsorption on electron-deficient Pd sites and further reduction on electron-rich Cu sites, delivering a high ammonia yield of 1510.3 µg h−1 mg−1cat. and a maximum Faradaic efficiency of 84.04 %.

Stable PtNb-Nb2O5 heterostructure clusters @CC for high-current-density neutral seawater hydrogen evolution,"© 2022Powerful, efficient, and corrosion-resistant electrocatalysts are in need to achieve high-current-density neutral seawater hydrogen evolution. Here, a novel strategy through strong metal-support interaction (SMSI) and incorporation of Pt to construct PtNb-Nb2O5 clusters @C was developed with stable high-current-density neutral seawater hydrogen evolution property for the first time. SMSI prevents agglomeration and corrosion of nanomaterials. Pt sites were proposed to play an anabranch role by binding H* to stabilize the Nb valence state and prevent water dissociation incapacitation. The optimized PtNb-Nb2O5 @CC delivers low overpotentials of 440 mV (500 mA cm−2) and 570 mV (1000 mA cm−2) in neutral seawater and has 360 h excellent durability at 500 mA cm−2. In-situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), in-situ Raman spectroscopies and theoretical calculations supported the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) mechanism. PtNb-Nb2O5 heterogeneous interface provided more active sites for water dissociation. OH* adsorbed on Nb sites in stable Nb2O5, and H* adsorbed on Nb sites and desorbed as H2 on Pt sites in stable PtNb. Overall, this work not only first achieves stable high-current-density neutral seawater hydrogen evolution property, but also opens a new opportunity to explore SMSI and incorporation of Pt to prevent agglomeration, corrosion, and water dissociation incapacitation for catalytic applications under high current densities.",Applied Catalysis B: Environmental
Dual-mode colorimetric and fluorescence sensing system for the detection of captopril based on Fe/NC nanozymes and carbon dots,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Metal nitrogen-doped carbon (M–N–C) nanozymes have received increasing attention in bio-catalysis filed due to adequate catalytic activity, outstanding stability and reusability. Herein, the Fe/NC nanozymes (Fe/NC NZs) with peroxidase-like activity was successfully synthesized and a fluorescence turn on and colorimetric dual-mode sensing system was developed for quantification of captopril (CP) based on Fe/NC NZs and orange-emitting carbon dots (O-CDs). The Fe/NC NZs as an enzyme mimic can efficiently catalyze the 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) chromogenic reaction, forming blue-colored oxidized TMB product (oxTMB) with the presence of H2O2, leading to the fluorescence quenching of O-CDs simultaneously via the inner filter effect (IFE). When CP was present, the blue oxTMB was reduced to colorless TMB, resulting in the inhibition of IFE and the recovery of fluorescence of O-CDs. The fluorescence increase of O-CDs and absorbance decrease of oxTMB depended on CP concentration. Good linear relationships of fluorescence and colorimetric sensing towards CP were obtained in the range from 1 to 50 μM, and the detection limits were 0.47 and 0.56 μM, respectively. Moreover, this as-constructed dual-mode sensor was used to detect CP in pharmaceutical products with satisfactory results.",Spectrochimica Acta - Part A: Molecular and Biomolecular Spectroscopy

It shows a marked electrocatalytic activity among several NiFe-based catalysts approaching those of noble-metal-based catalysts. That is, low overpotentials of -70 mV and -196 mV are enough to drive 10 mA cm-2 and 100 mA cm-2, respectively, of hydrogen generation in 1.0 M KOH. A foam-like film of Ni3Fe alloy is electrodeposited using the dynamic hydrogen bubble template (DHBT) method and shows a reasonable HER activity by delivering 10 mA cm-2 at -190 mV. Ni3Fe alloy is subsequently electropassivated by controlled repetitive cycling of potential in 1.0 M KOH solution to create NiFeOxHy/Ni3Fe interfaces, so a fast water cleavage occurs during HER boosting the overall rate. The electropassivation treatment is proven a successful technique to develop such metal/oxygenated metal junctions for improved HER kinetics in alkaline media. Various physicochemical analysis techniques such as XRD, SEM, EDS-mapping, ICP-OES, and XPS are employed to characterize the designed catalysts. The proposed NiFeOxHy/Ni3Fe catalyst layer is among the promising earth-abundant catalytic materials used for the electrolytic production of hydrogen in alkaline media.",Journal of Environmental Chemical Engineering
High-performance bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts for zinc-air batteries over nitrogen-doped carbon encapsulating CoNi nanoparticles,"© 2022 IOP Publishing Ltd.The nitrogen doped carbon (NC) encapsulating metal particles (metal/NC) are promising low-cost bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts for rechargeable Zn-air batteries. However, the states of the art catalytic performance are still significantly restricted by the limited content of active sites for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Herein, a series of NC encapsulating CoNi samples as a bifunctional catalyst for both ORR and OER were synthesized via a simple pyrolysis method.

Two-dimensional mineral hydrogel-derived single atoms-anchored heterostructures for ultrastable hydrogen evolution,"© 2022, The Author(s).Hydrogen energy is critical for achieving carbon neutrality. Heterostructured materials with single metal-atom dispersion are desirable for hydrogen production. However, it remains a great challenge to achieve large-scale fabrication of single atom-anchored heterostructured catalysts with high stability, low cost, and convenience.

Strong photodetection enhancement of quasi-2D transistor through defect engineering,"© 2022Two-dimensional materials have attracted a lot of attention in the field of electronics due to their unique electronic properties. With the development of defect physics, attention has been paid to how defects affect and control the electrical properties of two-dimensional materials by functionalizing defects into two-dimensional devices. We introduced defects into α-In2Se3 nanosheets by Ar2+ ion irradiation and artificially created defects in the atomic layers. Different defect types (single selenide vacancy defects, diselenide vacancy defects, and chain selenide vacancy defects) produced at different irradiation fluxes were identified by microscopic methods such as transmission electron microscopy. The defects affected the carrier mobility and the forbidden band width of the nanosheets, which improved the photodetection capability. The chain selenide vacancies have the greatest effect on α-In2Se3 phototransistors, increasing Iph, R, EQE and D* to 455%, 455%, 455% and 110% of the initial values, respectively.","Nuclear Instruments and Methods in Physics Research, Section B: Beam Interactions with Materials and Atoms"

The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of the Gd-doped CQDs showed the formation of highly amorphous carbon. The Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) results suggested that the CQDs are functionalized with C-N and N–H bonds. The synthesized CQDs with a size distribution of 2–8 nm have an absorption peak at 271 nm in UV–Visible spectroscopy (UV–Vis). The photoluminescence (PL) in CQDs was dependent on the excitation wavelength. The QY of the synthesized CQDs was calculated to be 13.2%. The Gd-doped CQDs exhibited sustained PL in ionic solutions with different ionic strengths and different temperatures up to 65 °C. Fluorescence imaging on mouse C34/connective tissue-L929 cells confirmed that Gd-doped CQDs could be well distributed over the cytoplasm. The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed that the Gd-doped CQDs have extremely high longitudinal and transverse relaxivity values of as high as 218.28 mM−1 s−1 and 364.68 mM−1 s−1.

Exceptional catalytic activity of oxygen evolution reaction via two-dimensional graphene multilayer confined metal-organic frameworks,"© 2022, The Author(s).Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) plays a key role in many renewable energy technologies such as water splitting and metal-air batteries. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are appealing to design efficient OER electrocatalysts, however, their intrinsic poor conductivity strongly hinders the activity. Here, we show a strategy to boost the OER activity of poor-conductive MOFs by confining them between graphene multilayers. The resultant NiFe-MOF//G gives a record-low overpotential of 106 mV to reach 10 mA cm−2 and retains the activity over 150 h, which is in significant contrast to 399 mV of the pristine NiFe-MOF. We use X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and computations to demonstrate that the nanoconfinement from graphene multilayers not only forms highly reactive NiO6-FeO5 distorted octahedral species in MOF structure but also lowers limiting potential for water oxidation reaction. We also demonstrate that the strategy is applicable to other MOFs of different structures to largely enhance their electrocatalytic activities.",Nature Communications

A realistic take on MXenes for electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.As part of concerted efforts in carbon capture and utilisation, electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) is a promising approach to realise a circular carbon economy. Two-dimensional metal carbides and nitrides (MXenes) have been touted as an attractive class of materials for CO2RR due to their tuneable electronic and surface properties, which provide a possible avenue to break linear scaling relations of intermediate binding energies that plague traditional transition metal catalysts. Despite the overwhelming number of theoretical studies with optimistic prospects for MXenes as CO2RR electrocatalysts, there remains a myriad of unresolved problems, alongside unexplored design opportunities, that require further experimental optimization to realise the promised potential of MXenes. Herein, we discuss how MXenes may break the above-mentioned scaling relations, as well as methods of MXenes modification that may improve their catalytic performance, including defect engineering and MXenes heterostructures. Lastly, we conclude by summarizing the current challenges and possible strategies to bring the potential of MXenes to fruition.",Diamond and Related Materials
Boosting SO2 electrocatalytic oxidation reaction on highly dispersed subnanometric Au/TiO2 catalyst,"© 2022The increase in the consumption of fossil fuels led not only to the increase of atmospheric CO2 level, but also to the increment in sulfur pollutants production, such as SO2. The electrochemical SO2 oxidation reaction (SO2OR) was already shown to be efficiently catalyzed by Au and, to further develop the technological knowledge in this field, the application of nanostructured Au catalysts is highly desirable. Herein we present a highly dispersed subnanometric Au/TiO2 catalyst as active material for SO2OR. The Tafel analysis revealed a change in the reaction mechanism and a substantial increase of the electrocatalytic reaction activity compared to bulk Au, even at conditions where bulk Au presented low activity, such as H2SO4 electrolyte. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) results led to the conclusion that TiO2 is also involved in the reaction, since not only the oxide time constant changes with the applied potential but also adsorbed intermediates were observed. This EIS response is probably related to the Au/TiO2 interface, which reflects on the oxide time constant.",Electrochimica Acta
Substituent effects in carbon-nanotube-supported diiron monophosphine complexes for hydrogen evolution reaction,"© 2022In order to explore substituent effects of PR3-phosphine ligands of diiron dithiolato complexes on the catalytic performances of [FeFe]-hydrogenase mimics for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in an aqueous medium, three new diiron monophosphine complexes [{(μ-SCH2)2N(C6H4CH2CH2OH)}Fe2(CO)5{P(C6H4R-4)3}] (labeled as FePR; R = F, H, and Me) were prepared and can be further linked covalently into carbon nanotube (CNT) to construct the target CNT-supported hybrids denoting as CNT-f-FePR. The molecular structures of diiron complexes FePR are well characterized through element analysis, fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and X-ray crystallography, whereas the formations of target hybrids CNT-f-FePR have been confirmed by using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Raman and FT-IR. Notably, the electrochemical HER performances of target hybrids CNT-f-FePR (R = F, H, and Me) are studied and compared in 0.1 M H2SO4 aqueous solution by means of linear sweep voltammetry (LSV), cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and density functional theory (DFT) calculation. Among these hybrids, the CNT-f-FePF hybrid exhibits a more efficient HER activity in an aqueous media based on their electrochemical observations that the CNT-f-FePF hybrid with F-substituted phosphine has lower applied overpotential, smaller Tafel slope, larger electrochemical active surface area, smaller charge transfer resistance, and lower hydrogen chemisorption free energy relative to its analogues CNT-f-FePH and CNT-f-FePMe with H- or Me-substituted phosphines.",Electrochimica Acta

It affords abundant three-phases heterostructure interfaces that effectively accelerate the electron transfer and trigger further electronic structure reconfiguration, thus advancing the bifunctional ORR/OER activities. Benefiting from these structures, the Co/Co9S8/MnS-NMC possesses a half-wave potential of 0.84 V toward ORR and a low overpotential of 330 mV toward OER at a current density of 10 mA/cm2, catching up with those of commercial Pt/C and RuO2 catalysts. It also endows the Zn–air batteries with a good power density, round-trip efficiency, and robust stability over 750 h, showcasing the promising potential in practical applications. This work not only provides a facile strategy to construct the three-phases heterojunction catalysts but also sheds light on developing the efficient and robust nonprecious metal-based bifunctional ORR/OER catalysts.",Materials Today Energy

Two-dimensional double transition metal carbides as superior bifunctional electrocatalysts for overall water splitting,"© 2022The development of bifunctional catalysts that can outperform precious metal electrocatalysts for overall water splitting is a critical task for sustainable green hydrogen production. Owing to the rich surface chemistry, unique physiochemical properties, and good stability, MXenes are considered efficient catalysts for hydrogen production. However, it is still a challenge to harmonize both HER (Hydrogen evolution reaction) & OER (Oxygen evolution reaction) reactions in the same media. Herein, we have reported the synthesis of Mo2TiC2Tx and Mo2Ti2C3Tx double transition metal carbides as NMP (non-precious metal) based bifunctional catalysts for overall water splitting in alkaline media. The LSV (linear sweep voltammetry) was employed for investigating catalytic activity, revealing the outstanding performance of Mo2TiC2Tx and Mo2Ti2C3Tx for high HER activity with an overpotential of 34 mV and 51 mV respectively, to reach a benchmark current density of 10 mAcm−2. The Mo2TiC2Tx also exhibited excellent OER activity with an overpotential of 320 mV as compared to 470 mV for Mo2Ti2C3Tx. The overall water splitting test uncovers a cell voltage of 1.57 V for Mo2TiC2Tx \\ Mo2TiC2Tx configuration. This study provides a comparison of two double transition MXene systems for effective use as bifunctional catalysts that opens new horizons for their use in clean hydrogen production.",Electrochimica Acta
Attenuating metal-substrate conjugation in atomically dispersed nickel catalysts for electroreduction of CO2 to CO,"© 2022, The Author(s).Atomically dispersed transition metals on carbon-based aromatic substrates are an emerging class of electrocatalysts for the electroreduction of CO2. However, electron delocalization of the metal site with the carbon support via d-π conjugation strongly hinders CO2 activation at the active metal centers. Herein, we introduce a strategy to attenuate the d-π conjugation at single Ni atomic sites by functionalizing the support with cyano moieties. In situ attenuated total reflection infrared spectroscopy and theoretical calculations demonstrate that this strategy increases the electron density around the metal centers and facilitates CO2 activation. As a result, for the electroreduction of CO2 to CO in aqueous KHCO3 electrolyte, the cyano-modified catalyst exhibits a turnover frequency of ~22,000 per hour at −1.178 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) and maintains a Faradaic efficiency (FE) above 90% even with a CO2 concentration of only 30% in an H-type cell. In a flow cell under pure CO2 at −0.93 V versus RHE the cyano-modified catalyst enables a current density of −300 mA/cm2 with a FE above 90%.",Nature Communications
Tailoring the active site for the oxygen evolution reaction on a Pt electrode,"© 2022, The Author(s).Highly active electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are essential to improve the efficiency of water electrolysis. The properties of OER active sites on single-crystal Pt electrodes were examined herein. The OER is markedly enhanced by repeated oxidative and reductive potential cycles on the Pt(111) surface. The OER activity on Pt(111) is nine times higher in the third cycle than that before the potential cycles. OER activation by potential cycling depends on the (111) terrace width, with wider (111) terraces significantly enhancing the OER. The oxidation/reduction of the Pt(111) surface produces atomic-sized vacancies on the terraces that activate the OER. Structural analysis using X-ray diffraction reveals that the active sites formed by potential cycling are defects in the second subsurface Pt layer. Potential cycling induces the bowl-shaped roughening of the electrode surface, wherein high-coordination number Pt atoms at the bottom of the cavities activate the OER.",Communications Chemistry
Well-defined metal-N4 sites coordinated defective carbon as efficient electrocatalysts for high performance lithium–sulfur batteries,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdThe practical application of lithium–sulfur batteries has been limited by the detrimental shuttling behavior and sluggish conversion kinetics of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs), especially under high sulfur loading and lean electrolyte dosage. Although experimental and theoretical studies show that introducing defect and Fe–N4 site in carbon materials is the desirable strategy to expedite LiPSs conversion, the synergetic effect between them for sulfur redox chemistry is hardly explored. Herein, derived from a well-define Fe–N4 macrocyclic pristine iron phthalocyanine molecules (FePc) coordinated on the defective carbon nanosheets (FePc-DC), the marriage and synergetic effect between defective carbon and FePc molecules can induce remarkable Fe center electron delocalization and regulate the local electron redistribution between FePc-DC interfaces, thus brings improved LiPSs adsorption ability and conversion reaction rate. Meanwhile, the robust two-dimensional flake texture with large surface area and abundant porosity ensures robust physical confinement and fast electron/ion transfer. Attributed to such unique features, the lithium–sulfur batteries with FePc-DC cathode delivers good electrochemical performance with high areal capacity of 5.53 mAh/cm2 under high sulfur mass loading of 4.9 mg/cm2 and low electrolyte/sulfur ratio of 6.5 μL/mg, demonstrating great potential in advanced Li–S batteries.",Materials Today Energy
DFTB investigations of structures and electron states for a decahedron Ti7 cluster on graphene on electrical level,"© 2022We performed self-consistent charge density functional tight binding simulations to investigate the interactions between a decahedron Ti7 cluster and graphene. Different adsorption behaviors of the cluster on perfect and defective graphene are characterized by adsorption energy, chemical potential, HOMO-LUMO energy gap, charge density differences, Mulliken populations on atoms, and molecular orbitals on HOMO and LUMO energy levels. Simulation results show that relatively contacting orientations of the cluster and graphene as well as adsorption positions greatly affect adsorption's packing configurations. The defective graphene improves high possibility for strongly binding the metal cluster. Apparent charge transfer occurs from the cluster to graphene for the adsorption on defective graphene. The molecular orbitals on the HOMO and LUMO energy levels present differences for different adsorption configurations.",Diamond and Related Materials
In situ observation of an atomically modified glassy carbon surface: From synthesis of an Fe-N-C catalyst to intrinsic combined reactions of hydrogen dissociation and the oxygen reduction reaction,"© 2022 The Author(s)We carried out an in situ ambient-pressure X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (AP-XPS) study on the catalytically active surface of glassy carbon subjected to nitrogen-ion implantation and subsequent iron deposition. We also used argon ions to intentionally induce carbon defects on the glassy carbon to compare the effects of substrate defects. Notably, water was produced spontaneously on the modified glassy carbon surface. We compared and clarified the surface structures of the samples in situ by AP-XPS and observed some differences among the pristine glassy carbon (PGC), Fe and N co-doped PGC, Ar-sputtered glassy carbon (AGC), and Fe and N co-doped AGC samples. These differences reveal the potential active site of oxygen reduction reaction and the inherent source for spontaneous dissociation of hydrogen molecules on the atomically modified surface of glassy carbon. The analysis illuminates the new property of glassy carbon itself and offer new direction of Fe-N-C catalyst preparation.",Diamond and Related Materials
Multi-Dimensional Composite Frame as Bifunctional Catalytic Medium for Ultra-Fast Charging Lithium–Sulfur Battery,"© 2022, The Author(s).The shuttle effect of soluble lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) between electrodes and slow reaction kinetics lead to extreme inefficiency and poor high current cycling stability, which limits the commercial application of Li–S batteries. Herein, the multi-dimensional composite frame has been proposed as the modified separator (MCCoS/PP) of Li–S battery, which is composed of CoS2 nanoparticles on alkali-treated MXene nanosheets and carbon nanotubes. Both experiments and theoretical calculations show that bifunctional catalytic activity can be achieved on the MCCoS/PP separator. It can not only promote the liquid–solid conversion in the reduction process, but also accelerate the decomposition of insoluble Li2S in the oxidation process. In addition, LiPSs shuttle effect has been inhibited without a decrease in lithium-ion transference numbers. Simultaneously, the MCCoS/PP separator with good LiPSs adsorption capability arouses redistribution and fixing of active substances, which is also beneficial to the rate performance and cycling stability. The Li–S batteries with the MCCoS/PP separator have a specific capacity of 368.6 mAh g−1 at 20C, and the capacity decay per cycle is only 0.033% in 1000 cycles at 7C. Also, high area capacity (6.34 mAh cm−2) with a high sulfur loading (7.7 mg cm−2) and a low electrolyte/sulfur ratio (7.5 μL mg−1) is achieved.[Figure not available: see fulltext.]",Nano-Micro Letters
Recent progress in the design of advanced MXene/metal oxides-hybrid materials for energy storage devices,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.The family of two-dimensional (2D) transition metal carbides, nitrides, and carbonitride, also called MXenes, have emerged as an attractive platform for constructing functional materials with enhanced properties for various energy applications. Transition metal oxides (TMOs) nanostructures supported on MXene nanosheets based on van der Waals interactions are facile, highly efficient, and low-cost, with self-assemble properties that can easily control their packing density. The resulting TMOs/MXene nanocomposites perfectly integrate the advantages of both components. MXene nanosheets can serve as conductive substrates to grow TMOs nanostructures which can facilitate fast electron and ion transport to prevent aggregation of TMOs nanostructures in energy applications. In turn, the TMOs nanostructures act as spacers to isolate the MXene nanosheets and prevent their re-stacking during assembly, enriching interfacial contacts and preserving the active sites. In this review, the recent advances of MXene/TMOs-based nanocomposites with enhanced performance for energy storage devices, such as supercapacitors (SCs), metal-ion hybrid capacitors (MIHCs), and various kinds of rechargeable batteries (RBs), are summarized and highlighted. We briefly discuss the synthesis methods, properties of MXenes, and the structural engineering of MXenes by introducing functionalized TMOs to achieve high-performance energy storage devices, such as in SCs, MIHCs, and RBs. Special attention is also given to MXene/TMOs nanocomposites-based SCs, HCs, metal-ion batteries, and metal-air/sulfur batteries. Finally, the crucial future outlook and perspective for developing MXene/TMOs nanocomposites for energy storage applications are also outlined.",Energy Storage Materials
Plasma-modified iron-doped Ni3S2 nanosheet arrays as efficient electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction,"© 2022 The AuthorsThe development of efficient transition-metal catalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction is significant to meeting global energy demands. In this study, to realize a high-performance electrocatalyst, we synthesize an Fe-doped Ni3S2 nanosheet material in situ on 3D structured nickel foam via the hydrothermal sulfide method, and then modify it by the dielectric barrier discharge plasma technique. Combining Fe atom doping and plasma modification increases the electrochemical surface area, provides an abundance of active sites, optimizes the electronic structure, and accelerates the reaction kinetics, thereby improving catalytic activity. As a result, the PA@Fe1/4-Ni3S2/NF catalyst exhibits excellent hydrogen evolution reaction activity, only requires ultra-low overpotentials to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm−2, and exhibits excellent durability. This study proposes a novel method for rationally designing non-noble metal electrocatalysts.",Arabian Journal of Chemistry
Polyamide aerogel-derived n-doped carbon aerogel decorated with platinum nanoparticles as highly active and stable electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdWe prepared polyamide aerogel (PA)-derived carbon aerogel (CA) supported Pt nanoparticles with the supercritical CO2 deposition (SCD) technique as electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). PAs were pyrolyzed at 800 °C to yield CPA and some CPA monoliths were subsequently etched with CO2 at 1000 °C to yield etched CPA (ECPA) to increase micro-mesoporosity and surface area in order to investigate their effect on the Pt nanoparticle dispersion and electrocatalytic performance towards ORR. The N-rich backbone of PAs yielded homogenously distributed N atoms in the CA structure enabling homogenous distribution of Pt nanoparticles, efficient dispersion of the Nafion ionomer and possible creation of ORR-active sites. Highly dispersed Pt nanoparticles with average size of 1.5 and 3.0 nm were obtained on CPA and ECPA, respectively. Pt-ECPA electrocatalysts showed enhanced electrochemically active surface area (ESA) and ORR mass activity when compared with commercial Pt-C. Pt-CPA showed similar ESA, mass and specific activity to that of commercial Pt-C due to lower mesopore volume and higher average Pt nanoparticle size. Accelerated stability tests (AST) revealed superior stability of Pt-CPA electrocatalyst due to favorable initial Pt nanoparticle size enabling successful immobilization Pt nanoparticles on CPA through the N-functionalities. Two important parameters, pore structure of carbon aerogel and initial Pt nanoparticle size, can be controlled through the powerful combination of sol-gel and supercritical deposition techniques to achieve both highly active and stable electerocatalysts.",Electrochimica Acta
Facile synthesis of N-doped graphene encapsulated Ni@N/C catalyst and its catalysis for highly selective semi-hydrogenation of alkynes,"© 2022 Institute of Process Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences.Although precious transition metals such as palladium, platinum, and iridium are widely used in hydrogenation reactions, the earth-abundant transition metal-catalyzed highly selective semi-hydrogenation of terminal alkynes to terminal alkenes remains poorly developed and a challenge. Herein we demonstrate the excellent selective, cost-effective semi-hydrogenation of terminal alkynes via a novel graphene encapsulated Ni@N/C catalyst. The graphene layer encapsulated nano-catalyst Ni@N/C could significantly avoid metal leaching and improve the stability of the catalyst. The strong interaction of nitrogen with the Ni nanoparticles regulates the activity of Ni towards selective semi-hydrogenation of terminal alkynes. Substrates having un-functionalized as well as functionalized substituents, and substrates having sensitive functional groups (olefins, ketones) which pose a challenge to hydrogenate, were semi-hydrogenated with excellent conversion (up to 99%) and selectivity (up to 99%) under optimized reaction conditions.",Green Chemical Engineering
Mechanistic insights into CO2 conversion chemistry of copper bis-(terpyridine) molecular electrocatalyst using accessible operando spectrochemistry,"© 2022, The Author(s).The implementation of low-cost transition-metal complexes in CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) is hampered by poor mechanistic understanding. Herein, a carbon-supported copper bis-(terpyridine) complex enabling facile kilogram-scale production of the catalyst is developed. We directly observe an intriguing baton-relay-like mechanism of active sites transfer by employing a widely accessible operando Raman/Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy analysis coupled with density functional theory computations. Our analyses reveal that the first protonation step involves Cu-N bond breakage before the *COOH intermediate forms exclusively at the central N site, followed by an N-to-Cu active site transfer. This unique active site transfer features energetically favorable *CO formation on Cu sites, low-barrier CO desorption and reversible catalyst regeneration, endowing the catalyst with a CO selectively of 99.5 %, 80 h stability, and a turn-over efficiency of 9.4 s−1 at −0.6 V vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode in an H-type cell configuration. We expect that the approach and findings presented here may accelerate future mechanistic studies of next-generation CO2RR electrocatalysts.",Nature Communications

Sulfadiazine advanced oxidizing-degradation: Defects generation by boosting electron transfer at interfaces of Co-Cu LDH catalysts,"© 2022 Elsevier Ltd.A comprehensive study of advanced oxidation was conducted over Co-Cu layered double hydroxide (LDH) catalysts, while the Co-Cu interaction mechanism at interfaces as well as oxygen vacancies (Ov) on the production of hydroxyl radicals (•OH) were studied. Cu could promote the oxidation of Co2+ by depressing the formation of β-Co(OH)2 and replacing Co sites in octahedral environment in α-Co(OH)2. A Co4Cu1 LDH catalyst showed the highest sulfadiazine (SDZ) removal efficiency of 93.7%. The reaction mechanism was assumed on the base of kinetics study of SDZ removal. The formation of Co-O-Cu oxo-bridge in MO6 surroundings can enhance the generation of ameliorated Ov, which improves the formation of surface hydroxyl for H2O2 adsorption by boosting electron-transfer rate under the Co-Cu interaction at interfaces.

The improvement in active sites due to siloxene was used to increase the catalytic activity. The hierarchical structure of the composite with the synergistic effect of metal oxides helped enhance the catalytic activity to show a low overpotential of 110 mV at 10 mA/cm2 in 1 M KOH and stability at 10 mA/cm2 over 20 h without an obvious change in voltage. The as-prepared catalyst can be a promising electrocatalyst for the HER owing to the low cost of transition metal oxides, the abundance of silicon on Earth, and the simplicity of the synthesis process.",Current Applied Physics
Hydrogen generation of single alloy Pd/Pt quantum dots over Co3O4 nanoparticles via the hydrolysis of sodium borohydride at room temperature,"© 2022, The Author(s).To satisfy global energy demands and decrease the level of atmospheric greenhouse gases, alternative clean energy sources are required. Hydrogen is one of the most promising clean energy sources due to its high chemical energy density and near-zero greenhouse gas emissions. A single alloyed phase of Pd/Pt nanoclusters as quantum dots (QDs) was prepared and loaded over Co3O4 nanoparticles with a low loading percentage (1 wt.%) for hydrogen generation from the hydrolysis of NaBH4 at room temperature. L-glutathione (SG) was used as a capping ligand. It was found that the single alloy catalyst (Pd0.5–Pt0.5)n(SG)m/Co3O4 caused a significant enhancement in hydrogen generation in comparison to the monometallic clusters (Pdn(SG)m and Ptn(SG)m). Moreover, the Pd/Pt alloy showed a positive synergistic effect compared to the physical mixture of Pd and Pt clusters (1:1) over Co3O4. The QDs alloy and monometallic Pd and Pt clusters exhibited well-dispersed particle size in ~ 1 nm. The (Pd0.5–Pt0.5)n(SG)m)/Co3O4 catalyst offers a high hydrogen generation rate (HGR) of 8333 mL min− 1 g− 1 at room temperature. The synergistic effect of Pd and Pt atoms in the nanoclusters alloy is the key point beyond this high activity, plus the prepared clusters' unique atomic packing structure and electronic properties. The effect of the NaBH4 concentration, catalyst amount, and reaction temperature (25–60 °C) were investigated, where HGR reaches 50 L min− 1 g− 1 at 60 °C under the same reaction conditions. The prepared catalysts were analyzed by UV–Vis, TGA, HR-TEM, XRD, and N2 adsorption/desorption techniques. The charge state of the Pd and Pt in monometallic and alloy nanoclusters is zero, as confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis. The catalysts showed high recyclability efficiency for at least five cycles due to the high leaching resistance of the alloy nanoclusters within the Co3O4 host. The prepared catalysts are highly efficient for energy-based applications.",Scientific Reports

The metal sites are protected by the carbon layer, which can reduce the corrosion of electrolytes and metal agglomeration during circulation, and improve the catalytic activity and stability. The catalyst was tested to have a high onset potential (Eonset = 1.02 V), half-wave potential (E1/2 = 0.86 V) and stability (negative shift 11 mV after 10,000 cycles). When assembled into Zn-air batteries, it also exhibits excellent specific capacitance (769.81 mAh/g) and power density (100.4 mW/cm2).

However, the poor electric conductivity of MOFs, leading to the low utilization of large amounts of active sites, greatly inhibits their practical applications in electrocatalysis. Herein, a binder-free, MOF-based nanofilm electrocatalyst for highly efficient and selective CO2RR is achieved by well-grafting conductive polypyrrole (PPy) chains into surface-mounted MOF (ZIF-8) nanofilm electrocatalyst based on a combination of the layer-by-layer assembly MOF growth technique and the in-situ electrochemical polymerization method. Experimental and theoretical results confirm that the grafting of PPy not only significantly accelerates the electron transfer for high utilization of active sites but also optimizes the electronic structure of the electrocatalysts for high electrocatalytic activity. As a result, the optimized ZIF-8@PPy nanofilm electrocatalyst exhibits the excellent electrocatalytic CO2RR performance with a selectivity of 96% and a current density of up to 18 mA/cm2 at −1.1 V. The strategy in this work has also demonstrated the broad potential application to a variety of other electrochemical purposes.",Materials Today Energy

Charge self-regulation in 1T'''-MoS2 structure with rich S vacancies for enhanced hydrogen evolution activity,"© 2022, The Author(s).Active electronic states in transition metal dichalcogenides are able to prompt hydrogen evolution by improving hydrogen absorption. However, the development of thermodynamically stable hexagonal 2H-MoS2 as hydrogen evolution catalyst is likely to be shadowed by its limited active electronic state. Herein, the charge self-regulation effect mediated by tuning Mo−Mo bonds and S vacancies is revealed in metastable trigonal MoS2 (1T'''-MoS2) structure, which is favarable for the generation of active electronic states to boost the hydrogen evolution reaction activity. The optimal 1T'''-MoS2 sample exhibits a low overpotential of 158 mV at 10 mA cm−2 and a Tafel slope of 74.5 mV dec−1 in acidic conditions, which are far exceeding the 2H-MoS2 counterpart (369 mV and 137 mV dec−1). Theoretical modeling indicates that the boosted performance is attributed to the formation of massive active electronic states induced by the charge self-regulation effect of Mo−Mo bonds in defective 1T'''-MoS2 with rich S vacancies.",Nature Communications
Direct strain correlations at the single-atom level in three-dimensional core-shell interface structures,"© 2022, The Author(s).Nanomaterials with core-shell architectures are prominent examples of strain-engineered materials. The lattice mismatch between the core and shell materials can cause strong interface strain, which affects the surface structures. Therefore, surface functional properties such as catalytic activities can be designed by fine-tuning the misfit strain at the interface. To precisely control the core-shell effect, it is essential to understand how the surface and interface strains are related at the atomic scale. Here, we elucidate the surface-interface strain relations by determining the full 3D atomic structure of Pd@Pt core-shell nanoparticles at the single-atom level via atomic electron tomography. Full 3D displacement fields and strain profiles of core-shell nanoparticles were obtained, which revealed a direct correlation between the surface and interface strain. The strain distributions show a strong shape-dependent anisotropy, whose nature was further corroborated by molecular statics simulations. From the observed surface strains, the surface oxygen reduction reaction activities were predicted. These findings give a deep understanding of structure-property relationships in strain-engineerable core-shell systems, which can lead to direct control over the resulting catalytic properties.",Nature Communications

Here we report a room-temperature one-pot two-step transformation of aryl acetonitriles to α,β-DAEAs with up to 92% isolated yield and 99% α,β-deuterium ratios using D2O as a deuterium source. The process involves a fast α-C − H/C − D exchange and tandem electroreductive deuteration of C ≡ N over an in situ formed low-coordinated Fe nanoparticle cathode. The moderate adsorptions of nitriles/imine intermediates and the promoted formation of active hydrogen (H*) on unsaturated Fe sites facilitate the electroreduction process. In situ Raman confirms co-adsorption of aryl rings and the C ≡ N group on the Fe surface. A proposed H*-addition pathway is confirmed by the detected hydrogen and carbon radicals. Wide substrate scope, parallel synthesis of multiple α,β-DAEAs, and successful preparation of α,β-deuterated Melatonin and Komavine highlight the potential.",Nature Communications

Here, we synthesized a composite CoP/Ni2P@Co(OH)2 catalyst via the sequential phase growth strategy. Owing to the cooperative effect between CoP/Ni2P and Co(OH)2, the CoP/Ni2P@Co(OH)2 catalyst presents excellent HER catalytic performance with 39 mV overpotential in 1 M KOH and 68 mV overpotential in 0.5 M H2SO4 to deliver the current density of 10 mA cm−2. By designing a control experiment, we found that the Co(OH)2 may promote water dissociation effectively in alkaline media and accelerate the generation of M-H∗ in acidic media, while CoP/Ni2P can serve as the active sites for the adsorption and desorption of hydrogen. The synergistic effects of CoP/Ni2P and Co(OH)2 greatly boost its HER catalytic performance in both alkaline and acid media.

Small molecule oxidation reactions with lower working potentials, such as methanol oxidation reactions, are good alternatives to OER with faster kinetics. However, the typically employed Ni-based electrocatalysts have poor activity and stability. Herein, a novel three-dimensional (3D)-networking Mo-doped Ni(OH)2 with ultralow Ni–Ni coordination is synthesized, which exhibits a high MOR activity of 100 mA cm−2 at 1.39 V, delivering 28 mV dec−1 for the Tafel slope. Meanwhile, hydrogen evolution with value-added formate co-generation is boosted with a current density of more than 500 mA cm−2 at a cell voltage of 2.00 V for 50 h, showing excellent stability in an industrial alkaline concentration (6 M KOH). Mechanistic studies based on density functional theory and X-ray absorption spectroscopy showed that the improved performance is mainly attributed to the ultralow Ni–Ni coordination, 3D-networking structures and Mo dopants, which improve the catalytic activity, increase the active site density and strengthen the Ni(OH)2 3D-networking structures, respectively. This study paves a new way for designing electrocatalysts with enhanced activity and durability for industrial energy-saving hydrogen production.[Figure not available: see fulltext.]",Nano-Micro Letters
"Carbon nanotubes doped with nitrogen, modified with platinum or platinum-free for alkaline H2-O2 fuel cell","© 2022 Elsevier LtdA series of cathodic and anodic catalysts for alkaline H2-O2 fuel cells (FC) deposited on the surface of functionalized and nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes (CNT) was synthesized and studied by various structural and electrochemical methods. It was established that, due to the minor defect structure, CNTNaOH (functionalized in alkali) exhibit high corrosion stability. A further increase in the activity in the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and the stability of CNTs is observed following their doping with nitrogen. The high activity of CNTNaOH+N is attributed to pyridine groups and the increased electrical conductivity of this catalyst. It was shown that CNTNaOH comprise effective substrates for hydrogen oxidation reaction catalysts. The PtMo/CNTNaOH system containing 12 wt% Pt at a molar ratio of PtMo= 1:1 is characterized by the highest catalytic activity among investigated anode platinum and non-platinum catalysts. The use of this catalyst made it possible to reduce the content of platinum to 0.1–0.2 mg/cm2, while preserving the characteristics that significantly exceed those of the active layer containing 60Pt/C (HiSPEC 9100) catalyst (0.6 mgPt/cm2).",Materials Today Communications
Hierarchical flower-like ternary composite of NiFeCr/PCN/CeO2 towards efficient photocatalytic reduction of CO2,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdSearching for semiconductor heterostructures with efficient photocatalytic activity and selectivity towards CO2 reduction is highly desired to lessen the speedy depletion of energy resources. Herein, a hierarchical flower-like ternary layered double hydroxides (LDHs) of NiFeCr-LDH-(PCN/CeO2-15%) was fabricated via in situ introduction of polymeric carbon nitride/cerium oxide (PCN/CeO2) and applied for photocatalytic CO2 reduction. The hierarchical flower-like heterostructure makes available more exposed surface-active sites to substantially enhance the light-harvesting capability. The charge transfer among the individual components stimulates the separation of photogenerated charge carriers and reduces their recombination rate, thus promoting the photocatalytic conversion towards CO2 reduction. The as-prepared NiFeCr-LDH-(PCN/CeO2-15%) heterostructure exhibits an exceptional photocatalytic CO formation rate of 52.1 μmol g−1 h−1, which is 7.1, 2.9, and 4.6 times than that of pristine PCN, PCN/CeO2, and pure NiFeCr-LDH, respectively. The magnificent photocatalytic activities are verified by the XPS and HRTEM evaluations, which demonstrate strong electronic interactions amongst heterostructure components. The present work not only achieves enhanced photocatalytic performance of NiFeCr-LDH-(PCN/CeO2-15%) heterostructure but also could provide a new approach to explore different LDHs-based semiconductors towards efficient CO2 reduction.",Journal of Physics and Chemistry of Solids
Atomically dispersed chromium coordinated with hydroxyl clusters enabling efficient hydrogen oxidation on ruthenium,"© 2022, The Author(s).Overcoming the sluggish kinetics of alkaline hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) is challenging but is of critical importance for practical anion exchange membrane fuel cells. Herein, abundant and efficient interfacial active sites are created on ruthenium (Ru) nanoparticles by anchoring atomically isolated chromium coordinated with hydroxyl clusters (Cr1(OH)x) for accelerated alkaline HOR. This catalyst system delivers 50-fold enhanced HOR activity with excellent durability and CO anti-poisoning ability via switching the active sites from Ru surface to Cr1(OH)x-Ru interface. Fundamentally different from the conventional mechanism merely focusing on surface metal sites, the isolated Cr1(OH)x could provide unique oxygen species for accelerating hydrogen or CO spillover from Ru to Cr1(OH)x. Furthermore, the original oxygen species from Cr1(OH)x are confirmed to participate in hydrogen oxidation and H2O formation. The incorporation of such atomically isolated metal hydroxide clusters in heterostructured catalysts opens up new opportunities for rationally designing advanced electrocatalysts for HOR and other complex electrochemical reactions. This work also highlights the importance of size effect of co-catalysts, which should also be paid substantial attention to in the catalysis field.",Nature Communications
O3-assisted low-temperature preparation of marginal S and graphitic N co-doped graphene oxide as high-performance electrocatalyst for bisphenol A degradation,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.In this research, a novel insight was provided for oriented low-temperature S and N doping into graphene oxide (GO).Given the gradual concern in the high-temperature dependence of traditional annealing method for the oriented design of heteroatom doping, utilizing O3 etching-assisted heteroatom doping can simultaneously resolve the problems of energy consumption and doping species design. In this research, with O3 etching, 100 at.% marginal S (C-SOX-C) and 92 at.% graphitic N co-doped O3-S/NGO were successfully synthesized at annealing temperature of 200 °C. Characterization results showed that S and N doping via O3 etching maintained the sheet-like structure of GO without much stacking (layer thickness of 4–5 nm). In addition, active defects were formed by O3 etching and S/N atom doping to provide active center for catalytic reaction. The electrocatalytic degradation behavior proved that 100 % bisphenol A degradation efficiency could be achieved by O3-S/NGO within 30 min and that the main active species generated during the reaction were O2•−, 1O2 and active chlorine. The possible pathways of bisphenol A degradation were also determined to complete the discussion. This project was based on the environmental demand of organic pollution control and suggested an optimal preparation strategy for high-performance catalyst preparation and utilization.",Diamond and Related Materials
High-throughput screening to predict highly active dual-atom catalysts for electrocatalytic reduction of nitrate to ammonia,"© 2022Ammonia is an essential chemical owing to its importance in fertilizer production and other industrial applications. Electrocatalytic nitrate reduction to ammonia (NO3RR) holds great promise for low-temperature ammonia production while simultaneously addressing nitrate-based environmental concerns. To provide the mechanistic understanding needed to design an effective electrocatalyst, we systematically investigated the catalytic performance of metal-based dual-atom catalysts (DACs) anchored on two-dimensional (2D) expanded phthalocyanine (Pc) for NO3RR. We found that NO3RR can efficiently produce ammonia on Cr2-Pc, V2-Pc, Ti2-Pc, and Mn2-Pc surfaces with low limiting potentials of − 0.02, − 0.25, − 0.34, and − 0.41 VRHE, respectively. Moreover, using the free energy difference of *NO3- and *H as a descriptor, we found that the hydrogen evolution reaction is significantly suppressed on the DAC surface due to an ensemble effect in which the two metal atoms cooperate to selectively form ammonia. We performed high-throughput screening to develop an efficient metal-based DAC for NO3- reduction, followed by a mechanistic study to elucidate the NO3RR pathway on the DAC. This work provides design information for advancing sustainable ammonia synthesis under ambient conditions.",Nano Energy
Recognition of the catalytic activities of graphitic N for zinc-iodine batteries,"© 2022Rechargeable aqueous Zinc-iodine (Zn-I2) battery is attractive because of its high energy density, intrinsic safety and eco-friendly. However, the formation of highly soluble triiodide (I3−) intermediates due to the sluggish iodine redox kinetics greatly compromise its durability and practical energy density. Here, we report that the formation and crossover of the triiodide could be suppressed by catalyzing the iodine conversion with nitrogen doped porous carbons, which afford a robust zinc iodine battery with high energy density (320 Wh·kg−1) and ultra-long cycle life of 10,000 cycles. Our fundamental studies reveal the electrocatalytic activities are sensitive to the type of N heteroatoms, as confirmed by the decreased activation energy, Tafel slope and improved faradic current density of the iodine redox took place on the graphitic N enriched host. These merits are stemmed from the significant electron redistribution from graphitic N in carbon to iodine molecules after interaction, which not only thermodynamically strengthen the adsorption/redox conversion efficiency but also dynamically boost the triiodide/iodide conversion by lowering the dissociation energy barrier. In addition, the favorable nucleation/electrodeposition of solid iodine on graphitic N during cycling also benefits such direct one step conversion. This work provides the reference basis for the correlation of the catalytic activities and performance of Zn-I2 batteries.",Energy Storage Materials
"Density functional theory study of Ni segregation in CuNi(111) alloy with chemisorbed CO, O, or H","© 2022 Elsevier LtdAdsorption-induced surface segregation can affect the electrochemical and catalytic properties of metal alloys. We have used density functional theory to study the Ni segregation in CuNi(111) alloy in presence of adsorbed CO, O, or H. The calculated results show that adsorbates can significantly affect the Ni segregation behavior on the CuNi(111) surface. In presence of adsorbed H, the Ni atom still prefers to stay in the bulk of the alloy as under vacuum conditions, while Ni atom prefers to segregate towards the alloy surface with adsorbed CO or O. Moreover, the analysis of the adsorption behavior of these three adsorbates and the electronic structure of the alloy surface indicates that the surface-adsorbate binding strength directly affects the Ni segregation behavior on the CuNi(111) surface in a reactive environment. This study provides a theoretical basis for the practical application of Cu–Ni alloy as CO2 reduction catalysts.",Journal of Physics and Chemistry of Solids

The emerging role of biochar in the carbon materials family for hydrogen production,"© 2022 Institution of Chemical EngineersThe energy crisis is at the top of global priorities. It left us with an option to progress with highly efficient materials for energy conversion, production, and storage systems. Carbon nano-allotropes have more accessible, and modifiable surface with excellent surface area, conductivity, catalytic activity, and other features. Biochar synthesized from renewable organic materials such as plants and animal waste, have beneficial physicochemical features (surface functionalities, porosity, adsorption capacity, etc.) and agronomic properties. They are influenced by several factors like the type of thermal treatment and feedstocks. Modification of biochar is an excellent option to obtain synergistic effects and sustainable materials. The current comprehensive review article will focus on biochar, selected nanocarbons (fullerene, carbon dots, nanotubes, nanodiamonds, graphene, and graphdiyne), and their hybrids for hydrogen evolution. Particular emphasis will be on biochar as these materials could be easily generated from different wastes. Biochar can have graphitized or non-graphitized carbon atoms. They can have carbon fragments resembling fullerene. This can be a potential low cost biocarbon alternative to graphene and fullerene and we are well aware of the importance of graphene and fullerene. Future projections in this paper may lead to an added foundation for “trash to treasure”/ “waste to wealth” and “waste to fuel” research and also contributes towards real-world applications in the clean fuel and sustainable energy sector.",Chemical Engineering Research and Design
Ternary heterogeneous core-shell structure CIP@PPy/MWCNTs composites for broadband microwave absorption,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Improving the microwave absorption performances of carbonyl iron powder by constructing heterogeneous core-shell structure is a known challenge. In this work, multiwalled carbon nanotubes have been successfully coated on the surface of carbonyl iron powder under the action of binder Polypyrrole. The microwave absorption performances of composites can be well adjusted by changing the average thickness of shell. Meanwhile, the maximum reflection loss can reach −64.29 dB with a thickness of 2.30 mm, while the maximum effective absorption bandwidth can achieve 5.80 GHz at a 1.77 mm thickness, which almost covers the whole Ku band. The excellent microwave absorption performance can be attributed to the synergistic effect of good impedance matching, magnetic loss, dielectric loss, conduction loss and transmission loss. Importantly, this novel ultra-thin composite is promising as candidate materials with excellent microwave absorption performances.",Diamond and Related Materials
Novel pyrite-type RuS2 adsorbent for elemental mercury capture in a wide temperature range,"© 2022 Energy InstituteMetal sulfides have attracted increasing attention in mercury emission control due to their high adsorption capacity and superior sulfur resistance. Nevertheless, the performances of most metal sulfides are still unsatisfactory due to their narrow working temperature window. Here, a novel pyrite-type RuS2 adsorbent is attained using a simple salt melt approach and used for capturing elemental mercury in simulated flue gas. RuS2 exhibits excellent mercury adsorption performance in a wide temperature range of 100–300 °C with mercury removing efficiency all above 78%. Hg0 capture performances of RuS2 can be distinctly influenced by annealing temperatures. RuS2-400 prepared at 400 °C displays the optimal mercury removal performance. Nitric oxide shows a negligible influence on Hg0 removal performance likely due to physical adsorption. Sulfur dioxide presents a subtle negative impact on Hg0 capture efficiency, which is irreversible.",Journal of the Energy Institute
High-throughput materials screening algorithm based on first-principles density functional theory and artificial neural network for high-entropy alloys,"© 2022, The Author(s).This work introduced the high-throughput phase prediction of PtPd-based high-entropy alloys via the algorithm based on a combined Korringa-Kohn-Rostoker coherent potential approximation (KKR-CPA) and artificial neural network (ANN) technique. As the first step, the KKR-CPA was employed to generate 2,720 data of formation energy and lattice parameters in the framework of the first-principles density functional theory. Following the data generation, 15 features were selected and verified for all HEA systems in each phase (FCC and BCC) via ANN. The algorithm exhibited high accuracy for all four prediction models on 36,556 data from 9139 HEA systems with 137,085 features, verified by R2 closed to unity and the mean relative error (MRE) within 5%. From this dataset comprising 5002 and 4137 systems of FCC and BCC phases, it can be realized based on the highest tendency of HEA phase formation that (1) Sc, Co, Cu, Zn, Y, Ru, Cd, Os, Ir, Hg, Al, Si, P, As, and Tl favor FCC phase, (2) Hf, Ga, In, Sn, Pb, and Bi favor BCC phase, and (3) Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Ni, Zr, Nb, Mo, Tc, Rh, Ag, Ta, W, Re, Au, Ge, and Sb can be found in both FCC and BCC phases with comparable tendency, where all predictions are in good agreement with the data from the literature. Thus, the combination of KKR-CPA and ANN can reduce the computational cost for the screening of PtPd-based HEA and accurately predict the structure, i.e., FCC, BCC, etc.",Scientific Reports
Enclosing the nitrogen cycle: Ammonia synthesis by NOx reduction,"© 2022Nitrogen cycling (N2-NOx-NH3) is essential for maintaining life as it is crucial in fertilizers and nucleic acids. However, the current NH3 synthesis (N2-to-NH3) for fertilizers and energy requires large amounts of fossil fuels and greenhouse gas emissions, compromising its eco-economic significance. Meanwhile, approaches like selective catalytic reaction are applied to neutralize the toxic NOx into N2 but call for value-added NH3 as the reduction agent. In this regard, directly converting harmful NOx, one of the major environmental pollutants, into NH3 is a promising way to balance the nitrogen cycle eco-friendly, which is still in its infancy. Recently, the electrocatalytic NOx reduction reaction (NOxRR) unveiled a potential route for the NOx-to-NH3 conversion. This review presents the latest progress in the electrocatalytic NOxRR in reaction mechanism and catalysts design. It will provide a comprehensive understanding to guide future research in NOxRR, aiming to offer sustainable chemistry and energy feedstocks for the carbon-zero economy.",Current Opinion in Green and Sustainable Chemistry
Materials property mapping from atomic scale imaging via machine learning based sub-pixel processing,"© 2022, The Author(s).Direct visualization of the atomic structure in scanning transmission electron microscopy has led to a comprehensive understanding of the structure-property relationship. However, a reliable characterization of the structural transition on a picometric scale is still challenging because of the limited spatial resolution and noise. Here, we demonstrate that the primary segmentation of atomic signals from background, succeeded by a denoising process, enables structural analysis in a sub-pixel accuracy. Poisson noise is eliminated using the block matching and three-dimensional filtering with Anscombe transformation, and remnant noise is removed via morphological filtering, which results in an increase of peak signal-to-noise ratio from 7 to 11 dB. Extracting the centroids of atomic columns segmented via K-means clustering, an unsupervised method for robust thresholding, achieves an average error of less than 0.7 pixel, which corresponds to 4.6 pm. This study will contribute to a profound understanding of the local structural dynamics in crystal structures.",npj Computational Materials
Volcano-type relationship between oxidation states and catalytic activity of single-atom catalysts towards hydrogen evolution,"© 2022, The Author(s).To date, the effect of oxidation state on activity remains controversial in whether higher or lower oxidation states benefit the enhancement of catalytic activity. Herein, we discover a volcanic relationship between oxidation state and hydrogen evolution reaction activity based on Os single-atom catalysts. Firstly, a series of Os SACs with oxidation states ranging from + 0.9 to + 2.9 are synthesized via modifying the coordination environments, including Os-N3S1, Os-N4, Os-S6, Os-C3, and Os-C4S2. A volcano-type relation between oxidation states and hydrogen evolution activity emerge with a summit at a moderate experimental oxidation state of + 1.3 (Os-N3S1). Mechanism studies illustrate that with increasing oxidation states, the adsorption of H atoms on Os is strengthened due to increased energy level and decreased occupancy of anti-bonding states of Os-H bond until the anti-bonding states become empty. Further increasing the oxidation states weakens hydrogen adsorption because of the decreased occupancy of Os-H bonding states. In this work, we emphasize the essential role of oxidation state in manipulating activity, which offers insightful guidance for the rational design of single-atom catalysts.",Nature Communications
"A Review of Nonaqueous Electrolytes, Binders, and Separators for Lithium-Ion Batteries","© 2022, The Author(s).Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) are the most important electrochemical energy storage devices due to their high energy density, long cycle life, and low cost. During the past decades, many review papers outlining the advantages of state-of-the-art LIBs have been published, and extensive efforts have been devoted to improving their specific energy density and cycle life performance. These papers are primarily focused on the design and development of various advanced cathode and anode electrode materials, with less attention given to the other important components of the battery. The “nonelectroconductive” components are of equal importance to electrode active materials and can significantly affect the performance of LIBs. They could directly impact the capacity, safety, charging time, and cycle life of batteries and thus affect their commercial application. This review summarizes the recent progress in the development of nonaqueous electrolytes, binders, and separators for LIBs and discusses their impact on the battery performance. In addition, the challenges and perspectives for future development of LIBs are discussed, and new avenues for state-of-the-art LIBs to reach their full potential for a wide range of practical applications are outlined.

Rapid complete reconfiguration induced actual active species for industrial hydrogen evolution reaction,"© 2022, The Author(s).Rational regulation of electrochemical reconfiguration and exploration of activity origin are important foundations for realizing the optimization of electrocatalyst activity, but rather challenging. Herein, we potentially develop a rapid complete reconfiguration strategy for the heterostructures of CoC2O4 coated by MXene nanosheets (CoC2O4@MXene) during the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) process. The self-assembled CoC2O4@MXene nanotubular structure has high electronic accessibility and abundant electrolyte diffusion channels, which favor the rapid complete reconfiguration. Such rapid reconfiguration creates new actual catalytic active species of Co(OH)2 transformed from CoC2O4, which is coupled with MXene to facilitate charge transfer and decrease the free energy of the Volmer step toward fast HER kinetics. The reconfigured components require low overpotentials of 28 and 216 mV at 10 and 1000 mA cm−2 in alkaline conditions and decent activity and stability in natural seawater. This work gives new insights for understanding the actual active species formation during HER and opens up a new way toward high-performance electrocatalysts.",Nature Communications
Coupling of nanocrystal hexagonal array and two-dimensional metastable substrate boosts H2-production,"© 2022, The Author(s).Designing well-ordered nanocrystal arrays with subnanometre distances can provide promising materials for future nanoscale applications. However, the fabrication of aligned arrays with controllable accuracy in the subnanometre range with conventional lithography, template or self-assembly strategies faces many challenges. Here, we report a two-dimensional layered metastable oxide, trigonal phase rhodium oxide (space group, P-3m1 (164)), which provides a platform from which to construct well-ordered face-centred cubic rhodium nanocrystal arrays in a hexagonal pattern with an intersurface distance of only 0.5 nm. The coupling of the well-ordered rhodium array and metastable substrate in this catalyst triggers and improves hydrogen spillover, enhancing the acidic hydrogen evolution for H2 production, which is essential for various clean energy-related devices. The catalyst achieves a low overpotential of only 9.8 mV at a current density of −10 mA cm−2, a low Tafel slope of 24.0 mV dec−1, and high stability under a high potential (vs. RHE) of −0.4 V (current density of ~750 mA cm−2).

Adsorbate chemical environment-based machine learning framework for heterogeneous catalysis,"© 2022, The Author(s).Heterogeneous catalytic reactions are influenced by a subtle interplay of atomic-scale factors, ranging from the catalysts’ local morphology to the presence of high adsorbate coverages. Describing such phenomena via computational models requires generation and analysis of a large space of atomic configurations. To address this challenge, we present Adsorbate Chemical Environment-based Graph Convolution Neural Network (ACE-GCN), a screening workflow that accounts for atomistic configurations comprising diverse adsorbates, binding locations, coordination environments, and substrate morphologies. Using this workflow, we develop catalyst surface models for two illustrative systems: (i) NO adsorbed on a Pt3Sn(111) alloy surface, of interest for nitrate electroreduction processes, where high adsorbate coverages combined with low symmetry of the alloy substrate produce a large configurational space, and (ii) OH* adsorbed on a stepped Pt(221) facet, of relevance to the Oxygen Reduction Reaction, where configurational complexity results from the presence of irregular crystal surfaces, high adsorbate coverages, and directionally-dependent adsorbate-adsorbate interactions. In both cases, the ACE-GCN model, trained on a fraction (~10%) of the total DFT-relaxed configurations, successfully describes trends in the relative stabilities of unrelaxed atomic configurations sampled from a large configurational space. This approach is expected to accelerate development of rigorous descriptions of catalyst surfaces under in-situ conditions.",Nature Communications

The intersection of these two disciplines could be an appealing way to pursue better performance of materials and devices. Herein this work reports the exploration of MOF derivatives and its ionic modulation for gating organic photoelectrochemical transistor (OPECT) biosensing. In the representative system of poly(ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) gated by zeolitic-imidazolate-framework (ZIF)-8-derived CdxZn1-xS, a high current gain could be achieved at zero gate bias.

Herein, a novel metal-organic framework (MOF)-derived carbon (PC)/nitrogen-doped three-dimensional reduced graphene oxide composite was prepared for CDI electrode material. In this nanoarchitecture, PC was attached to the N-doped graphene sheet, formed a hierarchical porous structure, and provided more active sites and ion transfer channels, which featured with enhanced the salt adsorption capacity (SAC) and rate. The carbonized products (NHG/PC-700) showed a high nitrogen content of 10.78 at.% and large surface area (432.3 m2/g), which was conducive to improve electric conductivity. Accordingly, the specific capacitance of 370.9 F/g and excellent long charge-discharge cycling stability were obtained at 1 A/g current density. In CDI experiments, the NHG/PC-700 electrodes displayed an outstanding SAC of 28.17 mg/g with an initial concentration NaCl solution of 500 mg/L, and the SAC was reduced 4.6% after six CDI regeneration cycles.

Metal-organic-framework-derived electrocatalysts for alkaline polymer electrolyte fuel cells,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Metal-organic frameworks were used as metal-nitrogen-carbon templates to synthesize Co–N–C catalysts through a facile synthesis approach that combined a cobalt-based zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF) structure and conductive carbon support. The spectroscopic, structural, and thermogravimetric analysis confirmed the synthesis of the Co-based ZIF, used to prepare catalysts with different ZIF/carbon support ratios by pyrolysis under inert atmosphere. Electrochemical characterization at alkaline pH demonstrated high activity towards oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). In addition to ORR activity, the Co–N–C electrocatalysts showed high methanol tolerance in the preliminary tests in a half-cell configuration. When assembled at the cathode side of both a hydrogen-fed anion exchange membrane fuel cell and an alkaline direct methanol fuel cell (ADMFC), the Co–N–C electrocatalysts showed competitive performance with the state-of-the-art Pt/C and other platinum-group-metal-free materials, using a FUMASEP® FAA-3-50 membrane. Exceptionally high performance (higher than 45 mW cm−2) was achieved in ADMFC fed with high methanol concentration (up to 10 M), due to the high methanol tolerance of Co–N–C electrocatalysts. Normalizing the performance to Pt loading, a value of 31.0 mW mgPt−1 was obtained, which is the highest power up to now recorded with this kind of membrane and one of the highest values in the literature for ADMFCs.",Journal of Power Sources
Building up libraries and production line for single atom catalysts with precursor-atomization strategy,"© 2022, The Author(s).Having the excellent catalytic performance, single atom catalysts (SACs) arouse extensive research interest. However, the application of SACs is hindered by the lack of versatile and scalable preparation approaches. Here, we show a precursor-atomization strategy to produce SACs, involving the spray of droplets of solutions containing metal precursors onto support surface through ultrasonic atomization and the subsequent calcination. This approach is versatile to successful synthesis of a series of catalysts, including 19 SACs with different metal sites and supports and 3 derivatives of SACs (single atom alloys, double atom catalysts and bi-metallic SACs). Furthermore, it can be scaled up by a homemade production line with productivity over 1 kg day−1, and the well-controlled catalyst uniformity is evidenced by the identical characterization results and catalytic properties in Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling. This strategy lays a foundation for further investigation and may accelerate the trend from basic research to industrial applications of SACs.",Nature Communications

The acquired formation energy result infers that the Pt dopant and vacancy can be obtained under an appropriate condition. Pt doping and vacancy can induce band levels and decreases the band gap of the two-dimensional ZnO. The decreased band gap enhances the light absorption in the visible light region, and therefore improves the visible energy utilization and expands the applicable range of ZnO. The water adsorption and dissociation properties of the two-dimensional Pt-doped ZnO are also studied in detail to explore its potential applications.

Constructing Cu1-Ti dual sites for highly efficient photocatalytic hydrogen evolution,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdConstructing dual sites is promising to break scaling relations between the adsorption energetics of reaction intermediates and ultimately improves the activity and selectivity due to the synergistic effect. However, it is a grand challenge to precisely form a dual-site configuration with one metal site adjacent to another active site. Loading single atoms onto oxides with pre-introduction of surface oxygen vacancies may be an alternative strategy to overcome such challenge. Motivated by our theoretical calculations that the dual sites formed by single Cu atoms and unsaturated Ti sites on TiO2 enables a higher activity towards hydrogen evolution from water splitting than corresponding single site, we successfully synthesized a Cu1-Ti dual-site catalyst by depositing Cu single atoms on TiO2 nanoparticles with abundant surface oxygen vacancies. The designed target catalyst significantly outperforms the benchmark Pt nanoparticle decorated TiO2 with a high and stable activity towards photocatalytic hydrogen production.",Nano Energy

Interfacial component coupling effects towards precise heterostructure design for efficient electrocatalytic water splitting,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdElectrocatalytic water splitting is an appealing method for generating renewable hydrogen. In acidic media, noble metals are commonly used as electrocatalysts, whereas in alkaline media, non-noble metals are used. However, due to the high cost and rarity of noble metals, as well as the low activity and stability of non-noble metals, industrial uses are severely constrained. Heterostructures are a possible alternative to costly electrocatalysts because of their tunable properties. The origin of activity and stability of heterostructures lies in the coupling between their constituent components. Thus, the establishment of interfacial component coupling effects such as the Mott-Schottky effect, the Strong-Metal-Support-Interaction effect, the support-stabilizing effect, and the synergistic effect is a promising technique for enhancing activity and stability. However, a lack of the generation rules for the interfacial coupling effects impedes their widespread application for the rational design. This review summarizes the progress made towards heterostructure design from the interfacial component coupling effects with respect to the various components.

Electron transfer via homogeneous phosphorus bridges enabling boosted photocatalytic generation of H2 and H2O2 from pure water with stoichiometric ratio,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdWe report efficient and simultaneous production of H2 and H2O2 from photocatalytic pure water splitting over a novel heterojunction photocatalyst made of red phosphorus (RP) and CoxP co-modified P-doped g-C3N4 (PCN). The success relies on the formation of RP as an intermediate to link CoxP and PCN, introducing atomic-level homogeneous P-P/P-P bonds in the heterojunction. The crafted P-P/P-P bridges as unique channels enable controllable and smooth charge flow via strong electronic coupling between each component in the composite photocatalyst, endowing a boosted carrier kinetics. More significantly, RP also facilities a Z-scheme charge transfer that induces two-electron photocatalytic H2 and H2O2 production from pure water in 1:1 stoichiometry. The highest activity reaches 15.26 μmol h−1 for bifunctional chemical evolution under simulated solar light irradiation, with the apparent quantum efficiencies (AQE) of 6.2 % at 366 nm and 3.6 % at 425 nm, without using any noble metals on 50 mg of photocatalyst. The new insights of phosphorus bridges can be applied to other composite photocatalysts for reinforced reaction kinetics towards value-added chemicals generation.",Nano Energy
Understanding electrocatalysis at nanoscale electrodes and single atoms with operando vibrational spectroscopy,"© 2022Electrocatalysis presents an environmentally benign route to carry out energy conversion reactions and organic transformations. The use of nanomaterials and single atoms as catalysts in electrochemical reactions has led to improvements in activity and selectivity over bulk electrocatalysts, however, optimal design of electrocatalytic reactions requires an in-depth understanding of the dynamic solid–liquid interface, reaction intermediates, and catalyst structural changes. Tracking bond breaking and formation events in real time is an important complement to catalyst characterization. This short review highlights advancements in fundamental understanding of electrocatalysis at nanoscale and single atom electrocatalysts obtained using operando vibrational spectroscopies. To push the boundaries of our fundamental understanding in electrocatalysis, we also emphasize a need to further develop operando vibrational techniques to reduce ensemble averaging with improvements in spatial and temporal resolution.",Current Opinion in Green and Sustainable Chemistry
Constructing lithium oxysulfide-rich solid electrolyte interphase to shield polysulfides in practical lithium–sulfur batteries,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Long-cycling practical lithium–sulfur batteries are hindered by the parasitic reactions between lithium polysulfide (LiPS) intermediates and lithium metal anodes. Solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) on lithium metal anodes plays a crucial role in shielding the parasitic reactions of LiPSs. Herein, a lithium oxysulfide-rich SEI is demonstrated to shield polysulfides for stabilizing lithium metal anodes in working lithium–sulfur batteries. Li2SO4 is sustainably released as an additive to introduce abundant lithium oxysulfide components, such as sulfates, sulfites, and other Li2SxOy in SEI. The lithium oxysulfide-rich SEI effectively shields the parasitic reactions of LiPSs and the lifespan of lithium–sulfur batteries increases by 60% under demanding conditions of ultrathin Li anodes (50 μm) and high-loading S cathodes (4.0 mg cm−2). Furthermore, a practical 2.59 Ah lithium–sulfur pouch cell with the lithium oxysulfide-rich SEI delivers 25 cycles with an initial specific energy of 352 Wh kg−1. This work provokes insights into the role of lithium oxysulfide in SEI and inspires rational regulation of SEI to stabilize lithium–sulfur batteries.",Journal of Power Sources
Tandem Co–O dual sites on halloysite with promoted reaction kinetics for sulfur reduction,"© 2022 Science Press and Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of SciencesFacilitating sulfur reduction reaction (SRR) is a promising pathway to tackle the polysulfide shuttle effect and enhance the electrochemical performance of lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries. Catalysts with a solo active site can reduce a reaction barrier of a certain transition-intermediate, but the linear scaling relationship between multi-intermediates still obstructs overall SRR. Herein, we construct tandem Co–O dual sites with accelerating SRR kinetics by loading highly dispersed cobalt sulfide clusters on halloysite. This catalyst features Co with upshifted d-orbital and O with downshifted p-orbital, which cooperatively adsorb long-chain polysulfide and dissociate an S–S bond, thus achieving both optimal adsorption–desorption strength and reduced conversion energy barrier of multi-intermediates in SRR. The Li-S coin batteries using the electrocatalyst endows a high specific capacity of 1224.3 mAh g−1 at 0.2 C after 200 cycles, and enhances cycling stability with a low-capacity decay rate of 0.03% per cycle at 1 C after 1000 cycles. Moreover, the strategy of the tandem Co–O dual sites is further verified in a practical Li-S pouch battery that realizes 1014.1 mAh g−1 for 100 cycles, which opens up a novel avenue for designing electrocatalysts to accelerate multi-step reactions.",Journal of Energy Chemistry
Controlled Synthesis of Carbon-Supported Pt-Based Electrocatalysts for Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells,"© 2022, The Author(s).Proton exchange membrane fuel cells are playing an increasing role in postpandemic economic recovery and climate action plans. However, their performance, cost, and durability are significantly related to Pt-based electrocatalysts, hampering their large-scale commercial application. Hence, considerable efforts have been devoted to improving the activity and durability of Pt-based electrocatalysts by controlled synthesis in recent years as an effective method for decreasing Pt use, and consequently, the cost. Therefore, this review article focuses on the synthesis processes of carbon-supported Pt-based electrocatalysts, which significantly affect the nanoparticle size, shape, and dispersion on supports and thus the activity and durability of the prepared electrocatalysts. The reviewed processes include (i) the functionalization of a commercial carbon support for enhanced catalyst–support interaction and additional catalytic effects, (ii) the methods for loading Pt-based electrocatalysts onto a carbon support that impact the manufacturing costs of electrocatalysts, (iii) the preparation of spherical and nonspherical Pt-based electrocatalysts (polyhedrons, nanocages, nanoframes, one- and two-dimensional nanostructures), and (iv) the postsynthesis treatments of supported electrocatalysts. The influences of the supports, key experimental parameters, and postsynthesis treatments on Pt-based electrocatalysts are scrutinized in detail. Future research directions are outlined, including (i) the full exploitation of the potential functionalization of commercial carbon supports, (ii) scaled-up one-pot synthesis of carbon-supported Pt-based electrocatalysts, and (iii) simplification of postsynthesis treatments. One-pot synthesis in aqueous instead of organic reaction systems and the minimal use of organic ligands are preferred to simplify the synthesis and postsynthesis treatment processes and to promote the mass production of commercial carbon-supported Pt-based electrocatalysts.

The calcium alginate-immobilized Co-g-C3N4 composite microspheres as an efficient mediator to activate peroxymonosulfate for degrading organic pollutants,"© 2022 Elsevier Inc.Poor water stability and difficult separation severely limited the application of Co-based catalysts in persulfate activation. Herein, for the first time, the calcium alginate-immobilized Co-g–C3N4–2 composite microspheres were prepared by a feasible method. Notably, embedding Co ion into g-C3N4 can improve its specific surface area and electrochemical activities. More significantly, as-prepared Co-g–C3N4–2 microsphere presented excellent catalytic performance in PMS activation for the degradation of TC. For the activation mechanisms of PMS over Co-g–C3N4–2 microspheres, the calcium alginate microspheres could mediate the direct electron transfer between TC and PMS, while both radical and nonradical pathways were involved in the activation of PMS over Co-g–C3N4–2. Meanwhile, SO4•−, OH•, O2•− and 1O2 were major reactive oxygen species formed in the Co-g–C3N4–2 microsphere/PMS system. Proposed Co-g–C3N4–2 microsphere/PMS system still exhibited great degradation ability towards TC over a wide pH range, and co-existing anions had weak influence on TC degradation over Co-g–C3N4–2 microsphere/PMS system. Moreover, the construction of Co-g–C3N4–2 microspheres not only avoided the release of metal ion from catalyst, but also provided convenience for the recovery of catalyst. In short, current work shared some novel insights into the application of heterogeneous catalysis in persulfate activation for wastewater treatment.",Environmental Research
"ZnS-assisted evolution of N,S-doped hierarchical porous carbon nanofiber membrane with highly exposed Fe-N4/Cx sites for rechargeable Zn-air battery","© 2022 Science Press and Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of SciencesBinder-free bifunctional electrocatalysts are attractive for rechargeable Zn-air batteries (ZABs) in grid-scale energy storage and flexible electronics, but suffering from the sluggish mass transport and inadequate catalytic capability. Herein, we propose a scalable approach of in-situ engineering highly exposed Fe-N4/Cx sites on the N,S-doped porous carbon nanofiber membrane as a binder-free air electrode catalyst for ZABs. ZnS nanospheres are firstly used as integrated structure-directing agents to facilitate the electronic modulation of Fe-N4/Cx sites by S doping and construct the hierarchical macro/meso/micropores at high temperature. Neither additional step for removal of ZnS nanospheres nor doping process is required, significantly simplifying the pore formation process and improving the S doping efficiency. Benefiting from the enhanced intrinsic activity of high-density Fe-N4/Cx sites (23.53 μmol g−1) and the optimized mass transport of carbon nanofibers, as-synthesized electrocatalyst shows a positive half-wave potential of 0.89 V for oxygen reduction reaction and a small overpotential of 0.47 V at 10 mA cm−2 for oxygen evolution reaction. When used as the air cathode catalyst for ZABs, it delivers a high specific capacity of 699 mAh g−1 at 5 mA cm−2, a large peak power density of 228 mW cm−2 and a prolonged cycling over 1000 h. At 10 mA cm−2, a robust structure with atomically dispersed Fe is also remained after cycling for 420 h. Due to the flexible properties of the electrocatalyst, as-assembled quasi-solid-state ZAB shows stable cycling over 90 h at alternately flat/bent states, demonstrating great prospects in flexible electronic device applications.",Journal of Energy Chemistry
Graphene/carbon structured catalyst layer to enhance the performance and durability of the high-temperature proton exchange membrane fuel cells,"© 2022 Science Press and Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of SciencesIn this study, nitrogen doped electrochemically exfoliated reduced graphene oxide and carbon black supported platinum (Pt/NrEGO2-CB3) has been prepared to enhance the performance and durability of high-temperature PEMFCs with lower Pt loading. On the one hand, Pt/NrEGO2-CB3 with the strong interaction between the Pt and nitrogen (N) prevent agglomeration of Pt particles and Pt particles is 5.46 ± 1.46 nm, which is smaller than that of 6.78 ± 1.34 nm in Pt/C. Meanwhile, ECSA of Pt/NrEGO2-CB3 decrease 13.65% after AST, which is much lower than that of 97.99% in Pt/C. On the other hand, the NrEGO flakes in MEAac act as a barrier to mitigate phosphoric acid redistribution, which improves the formation of triple-phase boundaries (TPBs) and gives stable operation of the MEAac with a lower decay rate of 0.02 mV h−1 within 100 h. After steady-state operation, the maximum power density of Pt/NrEGO2-CB3 (0.411 W cm−2) is three times higher than that of conventional Pt/C (0.134 W cm−2) in high-temperature PEMFCs. After AST, the mass transfer resistance of Pt/NrEGO2-CB3 electrode (0.560 Ω cm2) is lower than that in Pt/C (0.728 Ω cm2).",Journal of Energy Chemistry
Direct and in situ growth of 1T′ MoS2 and 1T MoSe2 on electrochemically synthesized MXene as an electrocatalyst for hydrogen generation,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdCrystal phase modulations in two-dimensional (2D) materials have garnered extensive interest because of their intriguing features and potential applications. Nonetheless, synthesizing some specific phases of metastable transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) remains a challenge due to the restricted selectivity under chemical and physical treatments, especially for direct growth of specific phase of TMDs on 2D substrates to form heterostructures. Taking the merits of MXene with tunable atomic vacancies and surface chemistry via surface functionalization, the phase of epitaxially grown TMDs on 2D MXene can be significantly affected. In this work, 1 T′-MoS2 and 1 T-MoSe2 were directly grown on electrochemically synthesized MXene under controlled oxidization conditions and selected MXene substrate. Owing to the synergistic effect of TMDs and MXene, the TMDs/MXene heterostructure catalysts exhibit good electrochemical activity under acidic conditions, with a low overpotential of 167 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm−2. Our work not only demonstrates the distinct chemical characteristic of various MXenes feasible for surface engineering which promotes the direct and in situ growth of phase controlled TMDs on MXene substrates but also displays the high electrochemical activity in TMDs/MXene heterostructure catalysts.",Nano Energy
Strain-regulated Gibbs free energy enables reversible redox chemistry of chalcogenides for sodium ion batteries,"© 2022, The Author(s).Manipulating the reversible redox chemistry of transition metal dichalcogenides for energy storage often faces great challenges as it is difficult to regulate the discharged products directly. Herein we report that tensile-strained MoSe2 (TS-MoSe2) can act as a host to transfer its strain to corresponding discharged product Mo, thus contributing to the regulation of Gibbs free energy change (ΔG) and enabling a reversible sodium storage mechanism. The inherited strain results in lattice distortion of Mo, which adjusts the d-band center upshifted closer to the Fermi level to enhance the adsorbability of Na2Se, thereby leading to a decreased ΔG of the redox chemistry between Mo/Na2Se and MoSe2. Ex situ and in situ experiments revealed that, unlike the unstrained MoSe2, TS-MoSe2 shows a highly reversible sodium storage, along with an evidently improved reaction kinetics. This work sheds light on the study on electrochemical energy storage mechanism of other electrode materials.",Nature Communications
Investigation of the adsorption of a DNA based purine derivative on N/B-doped coronene and coronene by means of DFT and NCI interaction analysis,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.With the aid of density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent DFT simulations, the adsorption of 2-amino-1,7-dihydropurin-6-one (ADO) on coronene and coronene that has been doped with boron and nitrogen has been investigated. While conducting this study, the binding energy, charge analysis, orbital analysis, quantum theory of atom in molecules (QTAIM) and surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) were taken into account. The coronene sheet serves as an electron acceptor while the nucleophilic portion of ADO acts as an electron-donor, causing intermolecular interaction with a focus on the reactive region. With the exception of coronene, all the complexes have negative Gibbs free energy changes due to ADO adsorption. Furthermore, enthalpy changes have low values for coronene complex (−5.18 kcal/mol) and large values for doped complexes (−255.56 to −284. 61 kcal/mol). Our calculations demonstrate that the most stable complex among the other systems under study. Is the ADO with nitrogen parallel doped complex, with a binding energy of −284.13 kcal/mol. Other doped complexes have lower energies with the pristine coronene complex having the lowest value. The NH, NH2, C[dbnd]O and ring modes of ADO possess more Raman intensity in the after adsorption and it is due to the enhancement mechanism due to SERS effect.",Journal of Molecular Liquids
Construction of S-Co-S internal electron transport bridges in Co-doped CuInS2 for enhancing photocatalytic CO2 reduction,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdThe visible-light-driven CO2 reduction efficiency by photocatalysts remains a bottleneck for CO2 photoreduction into valuable fuels. Herein, we rationally designed and fabricated Co-doped CuInS2 equipped with S-Co-S internal electron transfer bridges for the CO2 photoreduction. The S-Co-S bonding bridge decreases the work function and facilitates the reductive photogenerated electrons to migrate to the surface, thereby inhibiting the recombination of photoexcited charge pairs. Co dopants can work as the active centers and modulate the band configuration giving rise to higher electron density and more charge carriers for the photocatalytic reaction. In addition, the theoretical calculations further confirm that the doping Co helps to increase the concentration of free electrons near the Fermi level and reduce the formation energy of key reaction intermediate ∗COOH, thus lowering the CO2 reduction reaction energy barrier. Ultimately, the optimal CO formation rate was four times compared to that of ordinary CuInS2 under water vapor. This work emphasizes the importance of designing photocatalyst with internal electron transport bridges by Co doping in CuInS2 in tuning catalytic activity and offers an effective strategy for efficient reduction of CO2.",Materials Today Chemistry
Strategy to weaken the oxygen adsorption on single-atom catalysts towards oxygen-involved reactions,"© 2022 The AuthorsSingle-atom catalysts (SACs) are promising for 4e−oxygen reduction reaction (4e−ORR). However, they are rarely utilized in other oxygen-involved reactions, e.g. 2e−ORR to produce H2O2, 4e−oxygen evolution reaction (4e−OER), and 2e−water oxidation reaction (2e−WOR). Herein, we applied density functional theory (DFT) calculations to investigate the applicabilities of SACs, including Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Nb, Mo, Ru, Rh, Pd, Pt, and Au with axial coordination (e,g, –OH, =O, and ≡N) for all 4e−/2e− oxygen reactions. With axial coordination, SACs derived from early transition metals exhibit high catalytic performance, including V-SAC-OH with an overpotential of 0.61 V for 4e−ORR, Mo-SAC-OH with an overpotential of 0.05 V for 2e−ORR, Mo-SAC-O with an overpotential of 0.52 V for 4e−OER, and Nb-SAC-OH with an overpotential of 0.14 V for 2e−WOR. Among them, most SACs deliver a trend of adsorption-energy decreasing with the increase of axial bond, which successively meets various adsorption requirements of all 4e−/2e− oxygen reactions. This finding has led to the discovery of highly active SACs adapted to different oxygen reactions. Importantly, an intrinsic framework that combines SAC configuration, transition metal (TM) species, and TM charges was established to describe the adsorption ability of SACs. This work offers an intrinsic landscape to understand the correlation of the adsorption ability of SACs with the tendentiousness of oxygen-involved reactions and guides the rational design of SACs.",Materials Today Advances
Evolutionary face-to-face 2D/2D bismuth-based heterojunction: The quest for sustainable photocatalytic applications,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdThe energy demand is rising with the global population each day. The rapid growth in the manufacturing and energy industries has hit an unhealthy mark, losing control over the emission of harmful substances. Photocatalysis is considered to be one of the sustainable technologies for addressing the aforementioned problems. Two-dimensional (2D) bismuth-based nanomaterials have attracted extensive attention stemming from their visible light absorption ability. Nevertheless, pristine materials suffer from a high charge recombination rate. Heterojunction engineering has proven to effectively improve the separation efficiency of photogenerated charge carriers. Importantly, 2D bismuth-based materials have shown accelerated charge transfer mechanisms with the intimate face-to-face contact between nanostructures and a high adsorption rate as a result of the high surface-to-volume ratio that endows abundant active sites. Therefore, it is significant to elucidate the synergy effect between heterojunction and morphology engineering of bismuth-based photocatalysts.

A ZIF-8-derived copper-nitrogen co-hybrid carbon catalyst for peroxymonosulfate activation to degrade BPA,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdA series of copper-nitrogen co-hybrid porous carbon catalysts were prepared by pyrolysis of copper-doped ZIF-8 in argon atmosphere. Both the precursors and the corresponding pyrolysis products retained the polyhedral morphology of ZIF-8. The catalytic performance of the catalysts obtained at different Cu doping levels and pyrolysis temperatures for PMS activation was compared by bisphenol A (BPA) degradation experiment. Among them 5%Cu-NC(8) catalyst obtained by pyrolysis of 5%Cu-ZIF-8 at 950 °C showed the best catalytic performance. The catalytic mechanism of PMS activation catalyzed by 5%Cu-NC(8) was analyzed by quenching experiment, ESR and XPS. The degradation pathways of BPA in 5%Cu-NC(8)/PMS system were proposed on the basis of LC-MS analyses. Pyridine N (including Cu–N), graphite N, C[dbnd]O group and the valence change of Cu were recognized as the catalytic active sites for 5%Cu-NC(8). Both free radical and non-free radical processes were involved in BPA degradation, and singlet oxygen (1O2) was identified to be the main active substance. The stable performance and low Cu leaching rate in recycling experiment indicated that 5%Cu-NC(8) had good reusability and stability.

Recent Advances in Non-Precious Metal–Nitrogen–Carbon Single-Site Catalysts for CO2 Electroreduction Reaction to CO,"© 2022, Shanghai University and Periodicals Agency of Shanghai University.The carbon dioxide electroreduction reaction (CO2RR) to fuels and/or chemicals is an efficient prospective strategy to realize global carbon management using intermittent electric energy harvested from renewable sources. Highly efficient inexpensive electrocatalysts are required to achieve high energy and Faradaic efficiencies as well as fast conversion. Metal–nitrogen–carbon (M–N–C) single-site catalysts (SSCs) are highly competitive over precious metal catalysts in the CO2RR to CO due to their high performance, easy regulation and low cost. In the past six years, intensive studies of M–N–C SSCs for CO2RR to CO have been performed, and great progress has been achieved. This review focuses on the important topic of CO2RR to CO with M–N–C SSCs. We first introduce the reaction mechanism of the CO2RR to CO and the regulation of the electronic structure from a theoretical viewpoint. Then, the construction of M–N–C SSCs and the regulation of the electronic structure are demonstrated experimentally. The up-to-date electrocatalytic performance of M–N–C SSCs with different metal centers (Ni, Fe, Co and others) is summarized and compared systematically to highlight structure–performance correlations that were considered from both theoretical and experimental perspectives.

Pauling-type adsorption of O2 induced electrocatalytic singlet oxygen production on N–CuO for organic pollutants degradation,"© 2022, The Author(s).Due to environmentally friendly operation and on-site productivity, electrocatalytic singlet oxygen (1O2) production via O2 gas is of immense interest in environment purification. However, the side-on configuration of O2 on the catalysts surface will lead to the formation of H2O, which seriously limits the selectivity and activity of 1O2 production. Herein, we show a robust N-doped CuO (N–CuO) with Pauling-type (end-on) adsorption of O2 at the N–Cu–O3 sites for the selective generation of 1O2 under direct-current electric field. We propose that Pauling-type configuration of O2 not only lowers the overall activation energy barrier, but also alters the reaction pathway to form 1O2 instead of H2O, which is the key feature determining selectivity for the dissociation of Cu–O bonds rather than the O–O bonds. The proposed N dopant strategy is applicable to a series of transition metal oxides, providing a universal electrocatalysts design scheme for existing high-performance electrocatalytic 1O2 production.",Nature Communications
Construction of Ultrathin Layered MXene-TiN Heterostructure Enabling Favorable Catalytic Ability for High-Areal-Capacity Lithium–Sulfur Batteries,"© 2022, The Author(s).Catalysis has been regarded as an effective strategy to mitigate sluggish reaction kinetics and serious shuttle effect of Li–S batteries. Herein, a spherical structure consists of ultrathin layered Ti3C2Tx-TiN heterostructures (MX-TiN) through in-situ nitridation method is reported. Through controllable nitridation, highly conductive TiN layer grew on the surface and close coupled with interior MXene to form unique 2D heterostructures. The ultrathin heterostructure with only several nanometers in thickness enables outstanding ability to shorten electrons diffusion distance during electrochemical reactions and enlarge active surface with abundant adsorptive and catalytic sites. Moreover, the (001) surface of TiN is dominated by metallic Ti–3d states, which ensures fast transmitting electrons from high conductive MX-TiN matrix and thus guarantees efficient catalytic performance. Calculations and experiments demonstrate that polysulfides are strongly immobilized on MX-TiN, meanwhile the bidirectional reaction kinetics are catalytically enhanced by reducing the conversion barrier between liquid LiPSs and solid Li2S2/Li2S. As a result, the S/MX-TiN cathode achieves excellent long-term cyclability with extremely low-capacity fading rate of 0.022% over 1000 cycles and remarkable areal capacity of 8.27 mAh cm−2 at high sulfur loading and lean electrolytes.

Improved properties of 3d transition metal nanoclusters deposited on defective hexagonal boron nitride quantum dots,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdDensity functional theory calculations were used to investigate the stability and reactivity of icosahedral Fe13, Co13, Ni13, and Cu13 nanoclusters deposited on pristine and defective hexagonal boron nitride quantum dots (h-BNQDs). The defective h-BNQDs were studied with a N vacancy (h-BNVQDs) and a B vacancy (h-BVNQDs). The binding energy between the Fe13, Co13, Ni13, and Cu13 nanoclusters and pristine and defective h-BNQDs indicates that the stability of the Fe13, Co13, Ni13, and Cu13 nanoclusters deposited on defective h-BNQDs is higher than those deposited on pristine h-BNQDs. Therefore, defective h-BNQDs are better support material for these nanoclusters. Typically, it is observed that the charge is transferred from metal nanoclusters to pristine and defective h-BNQDs. On the reactivity of the metal nanoclusters deposited on pristine and defective h-BNQDs, the nanoclusters/h-BNQDs composites exhibit similar HOMO–LUMO gaps than bare nanoclusters. Consequently, the formation of nanoclusters/h-BNQDs composites is a good strategy to improve the reactivity of h-BNQDs.",Materials Today Communications
"Electrocatalytic activity of metal encapsulated, doped, and engineered fullerene-based nanostructured materials towards hydrogen evolution reaction","© 2022, The Author(s).The utilization of nanostructured materials as efficient catalyst for several processes has increased tremendously, and carbon-based nanostructured materials encompassing fullerene and its derivatives have been observed to possess enhanced catalytic activity when engineered with doping or decorated with metals, thus making them one of the most promising nanocage catalyst for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) during electro-catalysis. Prompted by these, and the reported electrochemical, electronic and stability advantage, an attempt is put forward herein to inspect the metal encapsulated, doped, and decorated dependent HER activity of C24 engineered nanostructured materials as effective electro-catalyst for HER. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations have been utilized to evaluate the catalytic hydrogen evolution reaction activity of four proposed bare systems: fullerene (C24), calcium encapsulated fullerene (CaencC24), nickel-doped calcium encapsulated fullerene (NidopCaencC24), and silver decorated nickel-doped calcium encapsulated (AgdecNidopCaencC24) engineered nanostructured materials at the TPSSh/GenECP/6-311+G(d,p)/LanL2DZ level of theory. The obtained results divulged that, a potential decrease in energy gap (Egap) occurred in the bare systems, while a sparing increase was observed upon adsorption of hydrogen onto the surfaces, these surfaces where also observed to maintain the least EH–L gap while the AgdecNidopCaencC24 surface exhibited an increased electrocatalytic activity when compared to others. The results also showed that the electronic properties of the systems evinced a correspondent result with their electrochemical properties, the Ag-decorated surface also exhibited a proficient adsorption energy (EadsH) and Gibb’s free energy (ΔGH) value. The engineered Ag-decorated and Ni-doped systems were found to possess both good surface stability and excellent electro-catalytic property for HER activities.",Scientific Reports
Photoinduced loading of electron-rich Cu single atoms by moderate coordination for hydrogen evolution,"© 2022, The Author(s).Single-atom catalysts offer maximal atom utilization efficiencies and high-electronegativity heteroatoms play a crucial role in coordinating reactive single metal atoms to prevent agglomeration. However, these strong coordination bonds withdraw electron density for coordinated metal atoms and consequently affect their catalytic activity. Herein we reveal the high loading (11.3 wt%) and stabilization of moderately coordinated Cu-P3 structure on black phosphorus support by a photochemical strategy with auxiliary hydrogen. Single-atom Cu sites with an exceptional electron-rich feature show the △ GH * close to zero to favor catalysis. Neighboring Cu atoms work in synergy to lower the energy of key water adsorption and dissociation intermediates. The reported catalyst shows a low overpotential of only 41 mV at 10 mA cm−2 and Tafel slope of 53.4 mV dec−1 for the alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction, surpassing both isolated Cu single atoms and Cu nanoclusters. The promising materials design strategy sheds light on the design and fabrication of high-loading single metal atoms and the role of neighboring single atoms for enhanced reaction kinetics.",Nature Communications
Asymmetric atomic sites make different: Recent progress in electrocatalytic CO2 reduction,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdElectrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) provides an effective solution to the problems of greenhouse effect and energy shortage. As one of the catalysts for CO2RR, symmetric M-N4 atomic moieties still suffer from low product selectivity and high reaction overpotentials. The asymmetric coordination configurations are expected to modulate the adsorption/desorption behavior of key reaction intermediates, thereby suppressing the occurrence of side reactions and accelerating the reaction rate. This review discussed the recent progress of asymmetrically coordinated atomic site catalysts in electrocatalytic CO2RR. The asymmetric atomic sites, including low-coordination sites, heteroatom coordination sites and bi-metal sites were presented, which could be induced by the breakage of M-N bonds or/and the formation of M-X bonds. The regulation of electronic structure, the optimization of reaction paths and catalytic selectivity towards asymmetric configurations were discussed. At last, several research prospects were proposed, aiming to deepen and promote the development of asymmetric sites for electrochemical CO2RR.",Nano Energy
Perforated nitrogen-rich graphene-like carbon nanolayers supported Cu-In catalyst for boosting CO2 electroreduction to CO,"© 2022 Science Press and Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of SciencesThe combination of a powerful CO2-enriching carrier and robust active component provides a new idea for the construction of efficient catalysts for electrocatalytic CO2 reduction. Herein, novel perforated nitrogen-rich graphene-like carbon nanolayers (PNGC) are prepared from biomass derivatives, which promotes the oriented deposition of In-doped Cu2(OH)3(NO3) nanosheet patches. A robust Cu-In/PNGC composite catalyst is then obtained via simple in-situ electrochemical reduction. Unsurprisingly, Cu-In/PNGC exhibits a CO Faradaic efficiency (FECO) of 91.3% and a remarkable CO partial current density (jCO) of 136.4 mA cm−2 at a moderate overpotential of 0.59 V for electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). DFT calculations and experimental studies indicate that the strong carrier effect of PNGC makes PNGC carried Cu-In nanosheets improved the adsorption capacity of CO2 gas, reconfigured electronic structure, and reduced free energy of key intermediate formation, thereby the CO2 activation and conversion are promoted.",Journal of Energy Chemistry
Mechanism of C-N bonds formation in electrocatalytic urea production revealed by ab initio molecular dynamics simulation,"© 2022, The Author(s).Electrosynthesis of urea from CO2 and NOX provides an exceptional opportunity for human society, given the increasingly available renewable energy. Urea electrosynthesis is challenging. In order to raise the overall electrosynthesis efficiency, the most critical reaction step for such electrosynthesis, C-N coupling, needs to be significantly improved. The C-N coupling can only happen at a narrow potential window, generally in the low overpotential region, and a fundamental understanding of the C-N coupling is needed for further development of this strategy. In this regard, we perform ab initio Molecular Dynamics simulations to reveal the origin of C-N coupling under a small electrode potential window with both the dynamic nature of water as a solvent, and the electrode potentials considered. We explore the key reaction networks for urea formation on Cu(100) surface in neutral electrolytes. Our work shows excellent agreement with experimentally observed selectivity under different potentials on the Cu electrode. We discover that the *NH and *CO are the key precursors for C-N bonds formation at low overpotential, while at high overpotential the C-N coupling occurs between adsorbed *NH and solvated CO. These insights provide vital information for future spectroscopic measurements and enable us to design new electrochemical systems for more value-added chemicals.",Nature Communications
OH spectator at IrMo intermetallic narrowing activity gap between alkaline and acidic hydrogen evolution reaction,"© 2022, The Author(s).The sluggish kinetics of the hydrogen evolution reaction in base has resulted in large activity gap between acidic and alkaline electrolytes. Here, we present an intermetallic IrMo electrocatalyst supported on carbon nanotubes that exhibits a specific activity of 0.95 mA cm−2 at the overpotential of 15 mV, which is 14.4 and 9.5 times of those for Ir/C and Pt/C, respectively. More importantly, its activities in base are fairly close to that in acidic electrolyte and the activity gap between acidic and alkaline media is only one fourth of that for Ir/C. DFT calculations reveal that the stably-adsorbed OH spectator at Mo site of IrMo can stabilize the water dissociation product, resulting in a thermodynamically favorable water dissociation process. Beyond offering an advanced electrocatalyst, this work provides a guidance to rationally design the desirable HER electrocatalysts for alkaline water splitting by the stably-adsorbed OH spectator.",Nature Communications
Electrochemical synthesis of Pt-decorated Au dendrite anode for constructing a direct formic acid fuel cell,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdScale-up fabrication of electrodes using a facile method is a challenge for the commercialization of direct formic acid fuel cells (DFAFCs). Herein, we report the facile fabrication of a Pt-decorated Au dendrite (Pt@Au-D) anode for DFAFCs. The Au dendrite was prepared by the galvanic displacement of Au on Ni-deposited carbon paper (CP) with a geometrical area of 10.2 cm2. The Pt islands were then electrodeposited on the Au dendrite with an extremely low Pt loading of 9.6 ± 0.1 μgPt/cm2. The Pt@Au-D/CP showed a current density of 27.1 mA/cm2 at 0.5 VRHE in an electrolyte consisting of 0.5 M HCOOH +0.5 M H2SO4, which was higher than those of state-of-art Pt–Au catalysts. Pt@Au-D/CP was employed as the anode for a DFAFC single cell coupled with a commercial Pt/C/CP cathode. The DFAFC single cell demonstrated a current density of 67.6 mA/cm2 at 0.4 Vcell and a maximum power density of 65.2 mW/cm2. Compared with state-of-the-art Pt–Au anodes, the Pt@Au-D/CP anode exhibited superior mass activity.",Materials Today Chemistry
Interface engineering breaks both stability and activity limits of RuO2 for sustainable water oxidation,"© 2022, The Author(s).Designing catalytic materials with enhanced stability and activity is crucial for sustainable electrochemical energy technologies. RuO2 is the most active material for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in electrolysers aiming at producing ‘green’ hydrogen, however it encounters critical electrochemical oxidation and dissolution issues during reaction. It remains a grand challenge to achieve stable and active RuO2 electrocatalyst as the current strategies usually enhance one of the two properties at the expense of the other. Here, we report breaking the stability and activity limits of RuO2 in neutral and alkaline environments by constructing a RuO2/CoOx interface. We demonstrate that RuO2 can be greatly stabilized on the CoOx substrate to exceed the Pourbaix stability limit of bulk RuO2. This is realized by the preferential oxidation of CoOx during OER and the electron gain of RuO2 through the interface. Besides, a highly active Ru/Co dual-atom site can be generated around the RuO2/CoOx interface to synergistically adsorb the oxygen intermediates, leading to a favourable reaction path. The as-designed RuO2/CoOx catalyst provides an avenue to achieve stable and active materials for sustainable electrochemical energy technologies.",Nature Communications
Identifying and tailoring C–N coupling site for efficient urea synthesis over diatomic Fe–Ni catalyst,"© 2022, The Author(s).Electrocatalytic urea synthesis emerged as the promising alternative of Haber–Bosch process and industrial urea synthetic protocol. Here, we report that a diatomic catalyst with bonded Fe–Ni pairs can significantly improve the efficiency of electrochemical urea synthesis. Compared with isolated diatomic and single-atom catalysts, the bonded Fe–Ni pairs act as the efficient sites for coordinated adsorption and activation of multiple reactants, enhancing the crucial C–N coupling thermodynamically and kinetically. The performance for urea synthesis up to an order of magnitude higher than those of single-atom and isolated diatomic electrocatalysts, a high urea yield rate of 20.2 mmol h−1 g−1 with corresponding Faradaic efficiency of 17.8% has been successfully achieved. A total Faradaic efficiency of about 100% for the formation of value-added urea, CO, and NH3 was realized. This work presents an insight into synergistic catalysis towards sustainable urea synthesis via identifying and tailoring the atomic site configurations.",Nature Communications
Etching-assisted synthesis of single atom Ni-tailored Pt nanocatalyst enclosed by high-index facets for active and stable oxygen reduction catalysis,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdDesigning structure and compositional distribution are critical for developing high-performance Pt-based oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalysts for fuel cells and other metal-air batteries. Here, we report a facile method to simultaneously dope single-atom Ni and expose high-index facets (HIFs) for Pt nanocrystals by chemical etching with HCl. The optimized catalyst displays a mass activity of 2.63 A mgPt−1 and specific activity of 4.15 mA cmPt−2 (0.1 M HClO4), which are both ∼15 times higher than those of commercial 20 wt% Pt/C. Particularly, it shows remarkably enhanced cycling stability. The density functional theory calculations and experimental results demonstrate that the construction of HIFs and single-atom Ni activation in Pt lattice lessen oxygen adsorption energy, which causes enhanced activity. Besides, regulating sub-layer Ni distribution also strengthens the Pt-Pt bonds on the surface, resulting in improved ORR stability.",Nano Energy

We have looked into its qualities as a component of a fuel cell to see whether it could be potentially used as an alternative replacement of the Pt catalyst. We used Density Functional Theory (DFT) to study H and CO interaction with the surface, and simulation of desorption process to study H and CO desorption from the surface. The bulk modulus and equilibrium crystal structures of Pd1−xAgx alloys were computed using the GPAW code within plane wave basis set & a PBE exchange correlation functional treatment. The best values of lattice constant for the system are obtained by total energy calculations versus lattice cell volumes as fitted to the stabilized jellium model. Surface energies, cohesive energies, and binding energy of Pd1−xAgx alloys were computed to analyze the stability properties of structures. Band structure calculations, density of states (DOS), and projected density of states (PDOS) reveal the electronic properties as well as the availability of the eigenstates for occupation. The desorption process is simulated based on the Arrhenius type desorption rate & a temperature programming. The effects of lateral interactions between adsorbed molecules is taken into account while analyzing first & second order desorption. The outcomes show good qualitative agreement with literature.",Computational Condensed Matter

Meanwhile, the previous approaches only involve direct co-assembly between monomer and micelle, which always give rise to the homogeneous, isotropic and limited nanoarchitectures. Herein, we report an unprecedented mesoporous conjugated fiber with isomeric core-shell nanoarchitecture by supramolecular interaction-driving multistage self-assembly. Theoretical modeling and extensively experimental investigations revealed the π-conjugated donors in the mesoporous fiber behaving as “electron reservoir” could efficiently immobilize and catalyze polysulfides conversion. The novel conjugated fibers featuring abundant functional groups, ordered mesoporous nanoarchitecture and enhanced electronic properties.

Revisiting the Role of Physical Confinement and Chemical Regulation of 3D Hosts for Dendrite-Free Li Metal Anode,"© 2022, The Author(s).Lithium metal anode has been demonstrated as the most promising anode for lithium batteries because of its high theoretical capacity, but infinite volume change and dendritic growth during Li electrodeposition have prevented its practical applications. Both physical morphology confinement and chemical adsorption/diffusion regulation are two crucial approaches to designing lithiophilic materials to alleviate dendrite of Li metal anode. However, their roles in suppressing dendrite growth for long-life Li anode are not fully understood yet. Herein, three different Ni-based nanosheet arrays (NiO-NS, Ni3N-NS, and Ni5P4-NS) on carbon cloth as proof-of-concept lithiophilic frameworks are proposed for Li metal anodes. The two-dimensional nanoarray is more promising to facilitate uniform Li+ flow and electric field. Compared with the NiO-NS and the Ni5P4-NS, the Ni3N-NS on carbon cloth after reacting with molten Li (Li-Ni/Li3N-NS@CC) can afford the strongest adsorption to Li+ and the most rapid Li+ diffusion path. Therefore, the Li-Ni/Li3N-NS@CC electrode realizes the lowest overpotential and the most excellent electrochemical performance (60 mA cm−2 and 60 mAh cm−2 for 1000 h). Furthermore, a remarkable full battery (LiFePO4||Li-Ni/Li3N-NS@CC) reaches 300 cycles at 2C. This research provides valuable insight into designing dendrite-free alkali metal batteries.[Figure not available: see fulltext.]",Nano-Micro Letters
Porous biochar aerogel loaded PtFe alloys derived from natural marine polysaccharide for efficient oxygen reduction,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdLowering the Pt loading of Pt-based materials is a promising strategy to explore excellent oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) electrocatalysts. One surprising approach is to develop Pt-alloys, which can effectively reduce the usage of Pt and induced highly catalytic activity through regulation effect between multimetals. Herein, the N-doped porous biochar aerogel/reduced graphene oxide loaded PtFe alloys (PtFe/NC-rGO (Pt1Fe5)) with low Pt loading (with a Pt content of 7.54 wt%) were prepared using natural marine polysaccharide-alginate as precursor through simple pyrolysis process. The biochar aerogel as an ideal carbon support shows an excellent electrical conductivity as well as a high specific surface area utilized for mass transport together with ion diffusion during ORR. Consequently, the PtFe/NC-rGO (Pt1Fe5) exhibits highly excellent ORR catalytic activity with respect to the pure Pt/NC-rGO together with the commercial Pt/C catalysts, with good half-wave potentials of 0.81 and 0.87 V vs. RHE in 0.5 M H2SO4 as well as 0.1 M KOH solutions, respectively. The strategy gives a new way to construct Pt-based alloy ORR electrocatalysts with low Pt consumption and the easy availability of biomass raw materials for PtFe/NC-rGO ensures its potential for large-scale application.",Materials Today Sustainability
Photoelectrochemical biosensing platform based on in situ generated ultrathin covalent organic framework film and AgInS2 QDs for dual target detection of HIV and CEA,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.In this work, a new photoelectrochemical (PEC) biosensing platform based on an ordered two-dimensional (2D) ultrathin covalent organic framework (COF) film and AgInS2 quantum dots (QDs) has been developed to enable dual-target detection of HIV and CEA. The porous COF film was firstly in situ generated on ITO, displaying super-stable and intense photocurrent with excellent repeatability. Moreover, an effective PEC quenching probe was specifically designed by loading large number of AgInS2 QDs on Au nanoparticles (NPs). After target HIV-induced cyclic amplification process to generate abundant DNA S0, the Au NPs-AgInS2 QDs probe was binded to the COF film through DNA hybridization, enabling PEC signal of the COF film to turn “off” for ultra-sensitive detection of HIV. Furthermore, when CEA as the second target specifically binded to its aptamer, the Au NPs-AgInS2 QDs quenching probe was released, achieving PEC signal “on” of the T-DA COF film for ultra-sensitive detection of CEA. This work opened a unique 2-D COF film-based PEC biosensing platform with excellent signal for rapid detection of dual targets, which can effectively avoid false positives and negatives and shows promising application for early prevention and detection of cancer diseases.",Biosensors and Bioelectronics
Study on the structure regulation and electrochemical properties of imidazole-based MOFs by small molecules,"© 2022 Elsevier Inc.In this work, four novel metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) were synthesized by the solvothermal reaction of the transition metal salts Co(NO3)2 with the mixed organic ligands 4,4′-sulfonyldibenzoic acid (H2SA) and 1,4-di(1H-imidazole-1-yl)-benzene (DIB) with the formula of [Co(DIB)0.5(SA)]•(DIB)0.5 (1), [Co(DIB)0.5(SA)] (2), [Co0.5(DIB)(HSA)]•(C10H8)0.5 (3) and [Co0.5(DIB)(HSA)]•(CH3CN) (4). Structural analysis manifested that complex 1 was assembled by the 2D Co-SA-DIB coordination networks constructed from the binuclear cobalt paddle-wheel secondary building units, while complex 3 was built from the 2D Co-DIB coordination networks based on the mononuclear cobalt center with the partially deprotonated HAS− ligand suspended on the two sides of the Co-DIB networks via the coordination between carboxylate and Co2+ cations. Furthermore, free DIB and naphthalene molecules functioned as the guest molecules to fill the pores in the structure of 1 and 3 respectively. More impressively, by just changing the used solvent, the free guest molecules DIB and naphthalene could be removed from the pores, and two novel MOFs, namely 2 and 4, could be obtained, whose framework architectures were identical to 1 and 3, respectively. In addition, the electrochemical properties of complexes 1–3 were checked as well and the results indicated that complex 3 exhibited the best electrocatalytic performance for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) with a low overpotential of 135 ​mV at the 10 ​mA ​cm−2 current density and a Tafel slope of 84 ​mV·dec−1. Moreover, it also possessed excellent stability with the maintainment of the current density up to 99.2% after 1000 cycles.",Journal of Solid State Chemistry
High-performance oxygen evolution reaction activity at low and higher current densities using nanostructured CeO2 and Plasma-assisted Bi@CeO2 electrocatalysts,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Herein, pristine nanostructured cerium oxide (CeO2) electrode (HC) was fabricated via an alkali-free hydrothermal, exhibiting high OER behaviors at low current density. The HC electrode displayed a low overpotential of 0.32 V, low Tafel slope of 61.6 mV dec-1, and high stability of 99.6 % for 15 h at a current density of 10 mA cm−2. To accelerate the kinetic of OER at high current density, a binary Bi@CeO2 plasma-activated electrode (PBC) was prepared as an effective electrocatalyst to evolve larger oxygen gas. The PBC electrode exhibited a low overpotential (0.42 V and 0.46 V) at higher current densities of 50 mA cm−2 and 250 mA cm−2, a small Tafel slope of 47.4 mV dec-1, and excellent stability of 99 % for 15 h at a current density of 100 mA cm−2.

High-efficiency sulfur-doped carbon photocatalysts synthesized by carbonization of lignosulfonate at low temperature,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdHeteroatom-doped carbon photocatalysts have attracted increasing attention since they are inexpensive, environmentally friendly, and highly efficient. Herein, sulfur-doped carbon photocatalysts were prepared by a one-step low-temperature carbonization method using sodium lignosulfonate (SLS) as a starting material. The physicochemical properties of the carbon photocatalysts were characterized by N2 adsorption-desorption, X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and so on. Compared with the carbon photocatalyst derived from alkali lignin, the sulfur-doped carbons from SLS can improve the degradation of tetracycline by nearly 40%. Sulfur species, i.e., sulfone and sulfoxide, can reduce the bandgap and promote the separation and transfer of photogenerated charge carriers under visible light irradiation. The recycling experimental results of S-C-N2-12 illustrate that the catalyst is stable without a remarkable loss in photocatalytic degradation of tetracycline after five successive runs, suggesting that the sulfur-containing species coordinated on the carbon surface are relatively stable. The results of radical-assisted electron spin resonance (ESR) and radical scavenger experiments show that h+ plays a major role in the degrading of tetracycline. These findings suggest that the sulfur-doped carbon photocatalysts have a great potential in pollutant degradation and wastewater treatment.",Materials Today Communications
Superior electron utilization of the intermetallic L10‑FePt-dispersed g-C3N4 for high-efficiency activating peroxymonosulfate,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Low electron utilization efficiency limits the peroxymonosulfate activation efficiency of the Fe-based activators. Herein, an intermetallic L10‑FePt-dispersed g-C3N4 (L10-FePt/g-C3N4) was designed and fabricated to enhance the electron utilization efficiency. Compared with the FePt compound, the peroxymonosulfate activation efficiency increased by 10% in the presence of L10-FePt/g-C3N4 with only 47% FePt dosage, and 97.4% endocrine disrupter (bisphenol A) was degraded in 30 min. Meanwhile, L10-FePt/g-C3N4 exhibited good cycle utilization performance and strong electrochemical stability. High electron utilization efficiency was derived from the successful construction of an intact electron transfer tunnel in the activator-peroxymonosulfate system, N (g-C3N4) → Fe (L10-FePt) → Pt (L10-FePt) → HSO5- (peroxymonosulfate), confirming by the density functional theory (DFT) calculation results.

Inner Co Synergizing Outer Ru Supported on Carbon Nanotubes for Efficient pH-Universal Hydrogen Evolution Catalysis,"© 2022, The Author(s).Exploring highly active but inexpensive electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is of critical importance for hydrogen production from electrochemical water splitting. Herein, we report a multicomponent catalyst with exceptional activity and durability for HER, in which cobalt nanoparticles were in-situ confined inside bamboo-like carbon nanotubes (CNTs) while ultralow ruthenium loading (~ 2.6 µg per electrode area ~ cm−2) is uniformly deposited on their exterior walls (Co@CNTsǀRu). The atomic-scale structural investigations and theoretical calculations indicate that the confined inner Co and loaded outer Ru would induce charge redistribution and a synergistic electron coupling, not only optimizing the adsorption energy of H intermediates (ΔG H*) but also facilitating the electron/mass transfer. The as-developed Co@CNTsǀRu composite catalyst requires overpotentials of only 10, 32, and 63 mV to afford a current density of 10 mA cm−2 in alkaline, acidic and neutral media, respectively, representing top-level catalytic activity among all reported HER catalysts.

Reversible hydrogen spillover in Ru-WO3-x enhances hydrogen evolution activity in neutral pH water splitting,"© 2022, The Author(s).Noble metal electrocatalysts (e.g., Pt, Ru, etc.) suffer from sluggish kinetics of water dissociation for the electrochemical reduction of water to molecular hydrogen in alkaline and neutral pH environments. Herein, we found that an integration of Ru nanoparticles (NPs) on oxygen-deficient WO3-x manifested a 24.0-fold increase in hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity compared with commercial Ru/C electrocatalyst in neutral electrolyte. Oxygen-deficient WO3-x is shown to possess large capacity for storing protons, which could be transferred to the Ru NPs under cathodic potential. This significantly increases the hydrogen coverage on the surface of Ru NPs in HER and thus changes the rate-determining step of HER on Ru from water dissociation to hydrogen recombination.",Nature Communications
Manufacturing 3D nano-porous architecture for boron-doped diamond film to efficient abatement of organic pollutant: Synergistic effect of hydroxyl radical and sulfate radical,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Electrochemical advanced oxidation process (EAOP) has caught increasing attention in purification of organic wastewater. However, its degradation performance is chiefly relevant to electrode micro-structure and radical species. Herein, the three-dimensional (3D) nano-porous boron-doped diamond (BDD) film with controllable nano-pore size is tailored for enhancing the production of hydroxyl radical (•OH) and activating sulfate to sulfate radical (SO4•-) in EAOP. The nano-porous BDD film favors interconnected porous structure, channel-like pores with size ranged from 10 nm to 1 μm, highly improved electron-transfer rate and large oxygen evolution potential (>2.0 V). It is effective for elimination of p-nitrophenol (PNP) with pseudo first-order kinetics rate of 1.14 × 10-2 min−1 and remove rate of 92.43 % after 180 min. The indirect oxidation is the dominant mechanism of PNP degradation. Benefited from enhanced active surface area and fast mass diffusion based on 3D interconnected porous channel, the generation of •OH increases from 1.41 mM to 2.20 mM after 180 min, which not only eliminates polymer intermediate, but also signally stimulates the degradation efficiency. Additionally, SO4•- is produced by activation of sulfate on the nano-porous BDD film, resulting in the 79.58 % of remove rate of chemical oxygen demand in Na2SO4 which is higher than that in NaNO3 (55.20 %). Oxidation of PNP with radical quenchers is conducted and PNP remove rate slightly decreases with addition of ethanol compared to that in presence of tert-butanol, indicating both •OH and SO4•- contribute to the oxidation of PNP but •OH is more important. Based on intermediate characterization, it's found that detachment of nitro, abstraction of hydrogen atom, cleavage of aromatic ring and decarboxylation reactions rapidly occur and effectively accelerate the mineralization of organic pollutant. This study enriches the EAOP application of nano-grade porous BDD film and broadens the aspect of designing porous electrode in the environment fields.",Separation and Purification Technology
Highly crystalline carbon nitride with small-sized sea urchin-like structure for efficient photocatalytic hydrogen production under visible-light irradiation,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdMolten-salt method has been deemed as a feasible strategy to increase the crystallinity of graphitic carbon nitride (abbreviated as CN), thereby improving its photocatalytic activity. However, highly crystalline CN prepared by molten-salt method using bulk carbon nitride (BCN) as the precursor still suffers from a small specific surface area, which is unfavorable to the separation of photogenerated carriers. Here, we report a facile approach to obtain highly crystalline CN with a large specific surface area using tubular carbon nitride (TCN) as raw material, and the final sample is named as tubular carbon nitride-molten salt (TCN-M). Compared with bulk carbon nitride-molten salt (BCN-M) sample, the obtained TCN-M sample not only retains the advantage of high crystallinity, but also exhibits a smaller-sized sea urchin-like structure owing to the CN precursor pretreatment process. The experiment results demonstrate that TCN-M displays an excellent hydrogen production activity of 4.9 mmol g−1 h−1 under visible-light, and its hydrogen production performance can be further enhanced to 14.7 mmol g−1 h−1 after adding 0.5 M K2HPO4. Thus, this work may supply valuable ideas to further optimize the photocatalytic activity of highly crystalline CN prepared by molten-salt method from the perspective of CN precursor pretreatment.",Materials Today Communications
Metal–carbon interaction in metal nanoparticles and implication in the electrocatalysis of oxygen reduction,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Electronic metal–carbon interaction plays a fundamental role in tuning the electrocatalytic behaviour of the metal active phase. The basis of the metal–carbon interaction is the presence of topological and structural defects as well as heteroatom functional groups such as nitrogen or sulphur that breaking the perfect symmetry of a graphene layer, provide preferential nucleation and growth sites for metal nanoparticles and single metal site. As will be shown, the interaction with the carbon support makes it possible to improve the size and dispersion of the particles as well as their reactivity by direct modulation of the electronic properties or by the introduction of interatomic strain. This is translated in an increased reactivity in electrocatalytic reaction as well as in an improved stability since sintering and leaching of metal NPs is hindered by the anchoring effect of the support. In addition, way for measuring and monitoring of metal–carbon interaction will be discussed. Finally, examples and perspectives on utilizing metal support interaction in electrocatalysis field and on O2 reduction reaction in particular will be given and discussed.",Current Opinion in Electrochemistry

Electrocatalytic hydrogenation of quinolines with water over a fluorine-modified cobalt catalyst,"© 2022, The Author(s).Room temperature and selective hydrogenation of quinolines to 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinolines using a safe and clean hydrogen donor catalyzed by cost-effective materials is significant yet challenging because of the difficult activation of quinolines and H2. Here, a fluorine-modified cobalt catalyst is synthesized via electroreduction of a Co(OH)F precursor that exhibits high activity for electrocatalytic hydrogenation of quinolines by using H2O as the hydrogen source to produce 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinolines with up to 99% selectivity and 94% isolated yield under ambient conditions. Fluorine surface-sites are shown to enhance the adsorption of quinolines and promote water activation to produce active atomic hydrogen (H*) by forming F−-K+(H2O)7 networks. A 1,4/2,3-addition pathway involving H* is proposed through combining experimental and theoretical results. Wide substrate scopes, scalable synthesis of bioactive precursors, facile preparation of deuterated analogues, and the paired synthesis of 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinoline and industrially important adiponitrile at a low voltage highlight the promising applications of this methodology.",Nature Communications
Recent advances in carbonaceous catalyst design for the in situ production of H2O2 via two-electron oxygen reduction,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdThe electrochemical oxygen reduction reaction has received increasing attention as a relatively green, safe and sustainable method for in situ hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production. Recently, significant achievements have been made to explore carbon-based (noble metal-free) low-cost and efficient electrocatalysts for H2O2 electroproduction, which could potentially replace the traditional anthraquinone process. However, to realize industrial-scale implementation, a highly active and selective catalytic material is needed. In this review paper, we first expound on the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) mechanism, which is the origin of in situ H2O2 production. Then, the recent progress in the development of modified carbon-based catalysts is reviewed and classified, corresponding to their physical or chemical modulation. Furthermore, an overview is provided of the available examples from pilot/large-scale applications.

Molecular and atomic manipulation of metal-organic framework-derived LiCoMnO4: An oxygen-deficient strategy for advanced lithium storage,"© 2022 Science Press and Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of SciencesAs a novel class of high-voltage cathode materials, spinel lithium transition metal oxides have been faced with demerits including pronounced structural instability caused by Jahn-Teller distortion (especially at the lower voltage region) and severe capacity degradation despite their intriguing electrochemical properties. To extend their functionalities as broad-voltage cathodes, the sacrificial template method has been regarded as a promising way to realize structural and compositional control for desirable electrochemical behaviors. Herein, we report a synthetic protocol to directionally prepare LiCoMnO4 (LCMO) using carboxyl-based metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) as self-sacrificing templates. Impressively, LCMO derived from CoMn-BDC (H2BDC = 1,4-benzenedicarboxylate) displays superior electrochemical performances with a specific capacity of 151.6 mAh g−1 at 1 C (150 mA g−1) after 120 cycles and excellent rate capacity of 91.9 mAh g−1 at 10 C due to the morphology control, microstructural modulation, and atomic manipulation of the MOF precursor. Bestowed by the optimized atomic and electronic structure, abundant oxygen vacancies, and the nanostructure retained from MOF precursors, LCMO materials display extraordinary electrochemical properties, which have been extensively verified by both experimental and theoretical studies. This work not only provides guidelines for the directional design of spinel materials at molecular and atomic levels but also sheds light on the practical use of LIBs with broad range voltage.",Journal of Energy Chemistry
Sustainable organic synthesis promoted on titanium dioxide using coordinated water and renewable energies/resources,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.There is an increasing demand to replace conventional industrial systems that emit massive amounts of CO2 with lower-carbon emitting systems, and this has spurred research on the application of renewable energy for chemical conversions. Hydrogen and other simple chemical products have been efficiently manufactured using renewable light energy or secondary energy sources, such as electricity. More importantly, the direct use of water as a ubiquitous and clean hydrogen (or electron) and oxygen source in organic synthesis has recently been realized. Semiconductor photo- and electrocatalysts, such as metal oxides, play significant roles in energy transformations and in the activation of reactant chemicals. This paper reviews recent developments in organic synthesis using water and renewable light or electric energy to achieve sustainable chemical production. TiO2 is especially featured as a reaction platform where both reactants and water are efficiently activated through coordination with the TiO2 surface. We also discuss the role of water in the reaction on the TiO2 surface from the perspectives of synthetic chemistry, physical surface chemistry, and nanomaterial chemistry.",Coordination Chemistry Reviews
Boosting electrochemical nitrate-ammonia conversion via organic ligands-tuned proton transfer,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdElectrochemical nitrate (NO3-) reduction reaction (NO3-RR) offers an ideal route to harvest ammonia (NH3) under ambient conditions. Despite recent advances in Cu-based NO3-RR electrocatalysts, their synthesis heavily relies on the regulation of adsorption strength towards nitrogen-containing intermediates, and other important factors are ignored (i.e., the proton transfer rate). Here, we select Cu nanoparticles (NPs) as model catalysts to investigate whether and how the proton transfer rate impacts the NO3-RR kinetics. The results indicate that the proton transfer is involved in the rate-determining step (RDS) of NO3-RR, and the weak water dissociation ability of Cu leads to slow proton transfer rate and consequently sluggish NO3-RR kinetics. To this end, we enhance the water dissociation ability of Cu NPs by incorporating uncoordinated carboxylate ligands to enable rapid proton transfer, which in turn boosts the hydrogenation of key intermediates for reducing the overall energy barrier of NO3-RR. As a result, Cu NPs with the ligands display a maximum NH3 yield rate of 496.4 mmol h−1 gcat−1, outperforming counterpart without ligands. This work not only deepens our knowledge on the NO3-RR mechanism, but also offers new guidelines for the smart design of efficient electrocatalysts.",Nano Energy

High-resolution high-angle annular dark-field scanning-transmission electron microscopy images show the high-density atomic steps on the faces of hexahedral Rh nanocrystals. Experimental results reveal the formation of stable sp–C~Rh bonds can stabilize Rh nanocrystals and further improve charge transfer ability in the system. Experimental and density functional theory calculation results solidly demonstrate the exposed high active stepped surfaces and various metal atomic sites affect the electronic structure of the catalyst to reduce the overpotential resulting in the large-current hydrogen production from saline water. This exciting result demonstrates unmatched electrocatalytic performance and highly stable saline water electrolysis.",Nature Communications

Physical Modifications and Algorithmic Predictions behind Further Advancing Two-dimensional Water Splitting Photocatalyst: An Overview,"© Engineered Science Publisher LLC 2022.It is becoming increasingly important to consider physical dimensions in addition to chemical capabilities when designing material for a specific feature. The physical dimensions, optical properties, surface area, and mechanical properties of material all play a role in determining its photochemical capabilities. In the two-dimensional (2D) materials, the surface area for the photoelectric effect and the long-range conductivity for homogeneous charge distribution in the photochemical reactions are perfectly balanced. A wide range of 2D materials has been investigated to date: low-cost, stable, earth-abundant, and hazard-free. However, photocatalyst efficiency must be improved to meet modern society's growing green energy demand. Photocatalysts are particularly interested in storing solar energy in chemical bonds to provide long-term energy. Researchers from various fields have recently contributed to properly arranging photocatalytic reaction centers in space, tuning the bandgap by modifying physical structures and chemical functionalities, using machine learning protocol, and calculating density functional theory (DFT) before preparing catalysts.

Ultrafine nanoporous intermetallic catalysts by high-temperature liquid metal dealloying for electrochemical hydrogen production,"© 2022, The Author(s).Intermetallic compounds formed from non-precious transition metals are promising cost-effective and robust catalysts for electrochemical hydrogen production. However, the development of monolithic nanoporous intermetallics, with ample active sites and sufficient electrocatalytic activity, remains a challenge. Here we report the fabrication of nanoporous Co7Mo6 and Fe7Mo6 intermetallic compounds via liquid metal dealloying. Along with the development of three-dimensional bicontinuous open porosity, high-temperature dealloying overcomes the kinetic energy barrier, enabling the direct formation of chemically ordered intermetallic phases. Unprecedented small characteristic lengths are observed for the nanoporous intermetallic compounds, resulting from an intermetallic effect whereby the chemical ordering during nanopore formation lowers surface diffusivity and significantly suppresses the thermal coarsening of dealloyed nanostructure. The resulting ultrafine nanoporous Co7Mo6 exhibits high catalytic activity and durability in electrochemical hydrogen evolution reactions. This study sheds light on the previously unexplored intermetallic effect in dealloying and facilitates the development of advanced intermetallic catalysts for energy applications.",Nature Communications

Advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) are an effective way towards water purification with qualified reactive oxygen species (ROSs) while are impeded by the high-cost and tedious process in either input of consumable reagent, production of ROSs, and the pre-treatment of supporting electrolyte. Herein, we couple solar light-assisted H2O2 production from water and photo-Fenton-like reactions into a self-cyclable system by using an artificial leaf, achieving an unassisted H2O2 production rate of 0.77 μmol/(min·cm2) under 1 Sun AM 1.5 illumination. Furthermore, a large (70 cm2) artificial leaf was used for an unassisted solar-driven bicarbonate-activated hydrogen peroxide (BAP) system with recycled catalysts for real-time wastewater purification with requirements for only water, oxygen and sunlight.

Meanwhile, rechargeable Zn-air batteries with prepared catalysts demonstrate high peak power density and good cycling stability.The performance promotion originates from the synergy between Co nanoparticles and highly dispersed Fe, porous structures, large specific areas, and distinct three-dimensional carbon networks. Abstract: Searching for cheap, efficient, and stable oxygen electrocatalysts is vital to promote the practical performance of Zn-air batteries with high theoretic energy density. Herein, a series of Co nanoparticles and highly dispersed Fe loaded on N-doped porous carbon substrates are prepared through a “double-solvent” method with in situ doped metal-organic frameworks as precursors. The optimized catalysts exhibit excellent performance for oxygen reduction and evolution reaction. Furthermore, rechargeable Zn-air batteries with designed catalysts demonstrate higher peak power density and better cycling stability than those with commercial Pt/C+RuO2. According to structure characterizations and electrochemical tests, the interaction of Co nanoparticles and highly dispersed Fe contributes to the superior performance for oxygen electrocatalysis. In addition, large specific surface areas, porous structures and interconnected three-dimensional carbon networks also play important roles in improving oxygen electrocatalysis. This work provides inspiration for rational design of advanced oxygen electrocatalysts and paves a way for the practical application of rechargeable Zn-air batteries.[Figure not available: see fulltext.].",Nano-Micro Letters
Pettifor maps of complex ternary two-dimensional transition metal sulfides,"© 2022, The Author(s).Alloying is an established strategy to tune the properties of bulk compounds for desired applications. With the advent of nanotechnology, the same strategy can be applied to 2D materials for technological applications, like single-layer transistors and solid lubricants. Here we present a systematic analysis of the phase behaviour of substitutional 2D alloys in the Transition Metal Disulfides (TMD) family. The phase behaviour is quantified in terms of a metastability metric and benchmarked against many-body expansion of the energy landscape. We show how the metastability metric can be directly used as starting point for setting up rational search strategies in phase space, thus allowing for targeted further computational prediction and analysis of properties. The results presented here also constitute a useful guideline for synthesis of TMDs binary alloys via a range of synthesis techniques.",npj Computational Materials
Movable type printing method to synthesize high-entropy single-atom catalysts,"© 2022, The Author(s).The controllable anchoring of multiple isolated metal atoms into a single support exhibits scientific and technological opportunities, while the synthesis of catalysts with multiple single metal atoms remains a challenge and has been rarely reported. Herein, we present a general route for anchoring up to eleven metals as highly dispersed single-atom centers on porous nitride-doped carbon supports with the developed movable type printing method, and label them as high-entropy single-atom catalysts. Various high-entropy single-atom catalysts with tunable multicomponent are successfully synthesized with the same method by adjusting only the printing templates and carbonization parameters. To prove utility, quinary high-entropy single-atom catalysts (FeCoNiCuMn) is investigated as oxygen reduction reaction catalyst with much more positive activity and durability than commercial Pt/C catalyst.

Electrocatalytic synthesis of adipic acid coupled with H2 production enhanced by a ligand modification strategy,"© 2022, The Author(s).Adipic acid is an important building block of polymers, and is commercially produced by thermo-catalytic oxidation of ketone-alcohol oil (a mixture of cyclohexanol and cyclohexanone). However, this process heavily relies on the use of corrosive nitric acid while releases nitrous oxide as a potent greenhouse gas. Herein, we report an electrocatalytic strategy for the oxidation of cyclohexanone to adipic acid coupled with H2 production over a nickel hydroxide (Ni(OH)2) catalyst modified with sodium dodecyl sulfonate (SDS). The intercalated SDS facilitates the enrichment of immiscible cyclohexanone in aqueous medium, thus achieving 3.6-fold greater productivity of adipic acid and higher faradaic efficiency (FE) compared with pure Ni(OH)2 (93% versus 56%). This strategy is demonstrated effective for a variety of immiscible aldehydes and ketones in aqueous solution. Furthermore, we design a realistic two-electrode flow electrolyzer for electrooxidation of cyclohexanone coupling with H2 production, attaining adipic acid productivity of 4.7 mmol coupled with H2 productivity of 8.0 L at 0.8 A (corresponding to 30 mA cm−2) in 24 h.",Nature Communications
"The Role of NMR in Metal Organic Frameworks: Deep Insights into Dynamics, Structure and Mapping of Functional Groups","© 2022 The Author(s)The fundamental understanding of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) is crucial since the relationship between the macroscopic properties of these materials and their molecular-level structures allows for the development of technological applications and improvements in current performance. The metal centers and attached functional groups dictate MOFs' dynamics, structure, and porosity. The development of the solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (SSNMR) technique, capable of providing atomic-level information, enables the non-destructive characterization of the structure and dynamics of MOFs have become essential step in ameliorating our understanding and are often complementary to traditional methods.

This review highlights the best experimental practices when working with these complex systems. The article scrutinizes the information on framework structures, active center, surface position, host-guest interaction, and intermediate interaction through different SSNMR spectrums.

Flexible self-supporting metal-free N-doped graphene membrane as an electrocatalyst for oxygen evolution reaction,"© 2022The exploration of highly active and low–cost non–noble metal or even metal–free electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) prove much vital for the development of advanced energy storage and conversion systems. Metal–free carbon–based electrocatalysts attract much attention due to their rich resource and low expenditure, but their practical application still remains as a huge challenge. In this work, flexible self–supporting metal–free N–doped graphene (NG) membrane is prepared by a blade coating assisted hydrothermal method. The morphology, structure and other physicochemical properties of this NG membrane are systematically characterized and analyzed. The results reveal that the resultant NG membrane shows unique flexible self–supporting architecture and achieves successful N doping, which guarantees excellent flexibility and tensile strength, and strengthens the intrinsic catalytic activity, electrical conductivity and hydrophilicity of NG membrane. As a consequence, when directly used as the OER electrocatalyst, the obtained NG membrane displays much promoted catalytic activity and stability, which is comparable or even superior to those previously reported metal–free electrocatalysts for OER. Obviously, this work provides a good guidance on developing low–cost and high–performance metal–free electrocatalysts for energy–related electrocatalytic reactions.",Applied Surface Science
Oxidation of methane and ethylene over Al incorporated N-doped graphene: A comparative mechanistic DFT study,"© 2022 Elsevier Inc.It is generally recognized that developing effective methods for selective oxidation of hydrocarbons to generate more useful chemicals is a major challenge for the chemical industry. In the present study, density functional theory calculations are conducted to examine the catalytic partial oxidation of methane (CH4) and ethylene (C2H4) by nitrous oxide (N2O) over Al-incorporated porphyrin-like N-doped graphene (AlN4-Gr). Adsorption energies for the most stable configurations of CH4, C2H4, and N2O molecules over the AlN4-Gr catalyst are determined to be −0.25, −0.64, and −0.40 eV, respectively. According to our findings, N2O can be efficiently split into N2 and Oads species with a negligible activation energy on the AlN4-Gr surface. Meanwhile, CH4 and C2H4 molecules compete for reaction with the activated oxygen atom (Oads) that stays on the surface. The energy barriers for partial methane oxidation through the CH4 + Oads → CH3° + HOads and CH3° + HOads → CH3OH reaction steps are 0.16 eV and 0.27 eV, respectively. Furthermore, the produced CH3OH may be overoxidized by Oads to give formaldehyde and water molecules by overcoming a relatively low activation barrier. The activation barriers for C2H4 epoxidation are small and comparable to those for CH4 oxidation, implying that AlN4-Gr is highly active for both reactions. The high energy barrier for the 1,2-hydrogen shift in the OCH2CH2 intermediate, on the other hand, makes the production of acetaldehyde impossible under normal conditions. According to the population analysis, the AlN4-Gr serves as a strong electron donor to aid in the charge transfer between the Al atom and the Oads moiety, which is necessary for the activation of CH4 and C2H4. The findings of the present study may pave the way for a better understanding of the catalytic oxidation the CH4 and C2H4, as well as for the development of highly efficient noble-metal free catalysts for these reactions.",Journal of Molecular Graphics and Modelling
Optimizing hydrogen adsorption of NixB cocatalyst by integrating P atom for enhanced photocatalytic H2-production activity of CdS,"© 2022Developing low-cost and long-lasting nickel boride (NixB) for hydrogen evolution reaction is desirable to favor the present renewable energy system. However, H atom adsorption on Ni active site is weakened by the electron transfer from B to Ni atom in NixB, causing the inhibited hydrogen-evolution process. Herein, the metalloid P is introduced into NixB to regulate the electron density of Ni active site, with the aim of enhancing its H atom adsorption to boost the photocatalytic H2-production activity of CdS. In this regard, the NixPB cocatalysts with a size of 8–10 nm are loaded on reduced graphene oxide (rGO) to produce NixPB-rGO cocatalyst, which was well coupled with CdS to prepare the NixPB-rGO/CdS photocatalyst. Photocatalytic hydrogen-evolution tests suggested that the NixPB-rGO/CdS photocatalyst displayed the highest H2-evolution rate of 5.79 mmol h−1 g−1, which is 1.8 and 9.9 times over the NixB-rGO/CdS and rGO/CdS photocatalysts, respectively. The above improved activity of NixPB-rGO/CdS photocatalyst can be attributed to the promoting hydrogen adsorption of Ni atom for efficient interfacial H2 production via the facile introduction of P heteroatom. This work provides a feasible strategy to optimize the transition metal borides cocatalysts for the photocatalytic H2 evolution.",Applied Surface Science
Review on recent progress and reactor set-ups for hydrogen production from formic acid decomposition,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdHydrogen is a clean and efficient energy carrier, and a hydrogen-based economy is an alternative solution for sustainability. The present work reviews the recent progress for hydrogen's production from various technologies including the generation from fossil fuels, from biomass through biological and thermochemical processes and from water splitting. Although hydrogen is a zero-emission energy when it is used, its cleanness depends on the production pathway that preceded. Hydrogen's storage and transportation has been costly and an unsafe procedure; formic acid (FA; CH2O2), on the other hand, can be generated, transported, and decomposed easily to hydrogen. Formic acid is generated from the hydrogenation of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) and can easily be provided with energy portable devices, vehicles, and other applications. In addition, the most widely known homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts and reactors for the formic acid reaction are presented. Different types of reactors like, fixed-bed reactors (FBRs), batch reactors, continuously stirred tank reactors (CSTRs) and microreactors were assessed for their performance and reaction's efficiency during formic acid's decomposition.",Materials Today Chemistry
Intercalation optimized hexagonal boron nitride nanosheets for high efficiency hydrogen storage,"© 2022Atomic doping or polymer grafting can significantly improve the hydrogen sorption performance of hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) based materials. Herein, this paper reported h-BN nanosheets grafting degradable L-polylactic acid (PLLA) and h-BN nanosheets doping nickel nanoparticles (Ni NPs) for high efficiency hydrogen storage. Firstly, h-BN material was treated by sodium hydroxide solution, which the electronegativity B atom connected with –OH covalently and h-BN nanosheets would disperse uniformly. Then, Ni-h-BN powder would be achieved by calcining the mixture of Ni precursor and h-BN at 600 °C. PLLA-h-BN film would be achieved by PLLA composite alkali modified h-BN, so that the long molecular chains of PLLA were grafted to h-BN nanosheets. The experiment found h-BN nanosheets dope trace Ni and h-BN nanosheets graft PLLA would improve H2 sorption ability of h-BN by adjusting electron structure and expanding interlayer space of h-BN, simultaneously. The test indicted Ni-h-BN has H2 storage capacity of 7.3 wt%, PLLA-h-BN has H2 storage capacity of 6.1 wt% at room temperature and 15 bar, these h-BN materials exhibited an optimistic hydrogen storage performance than h-BN materials previously reported in literature.

First-principles study on electronic and optical properties of van der Waals heterostructures stacked by g-ZnO and Janus-WSSe monolayers,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.In this paper, we designed van der Waals heterostructures by stacking g-ZnO and Janus WSSe monlayers with each other, and selected two most stable structures of them for in-depth study. The AA-stacking g-ZnO/Janus-WSeS heterostructure shows a type-I band arrangement. Staggered gap of AB-stacking g-ZnO/Janus-WSS heterostructure indicates it exhibits a typical type-II band arrangement. Further investigations show that the band alignment of AB-stacking g-ZnO/Janus-WSS heterostructure meets the requirement of water redox potentials at PH = 7. To explore the regulation effect on these two heterostructures, a biaxial strain parallel to the stacking layers from −6 to 8 % is applied. Results show the type-I AA-stacking g-ZnO/Janus-WSeS vdW heterostructure can be transformed to type-II under a moderate negative biaxial strain. For AB-stacking g-ZnO/Janus-WSSe vdW heterostructure, a suitable strain can be applied to tune the band gap and the band alignment to meet the requirement of photoelectric devices. In addition, the absorption coefficients of these two heterostructures at different strains were calculated. Results show negative strain will enhance the absorption of UV light and weaken the absorption of visible light. The favorable band edge positions and strong absorption in visible light and UV light make the AB-stacking g-ZnO/Janus-WSSe vdW heterostructure as a potential UV irradiation catalyst for water splitting.",Applied Surface Science
Mo-embedded Ir-based electrocatalyst for nitrogen reduction reaction: A computational study,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdAmmonia has a wide range of applications, including as a fertilizer and important chemical feedstock. Therefore, its catalytic synthesis is critical to global agricultural and industrial production. A widely used method of NH3 synthesis in industry is the Haber–Bosch process. However, the energy consumption of this process is high, making it an environmentally unfriendly technology. As a result, methods for NH3 synthesis at room temperature and pressure are urgently required. The electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) is widely regarded as a green and sustainable method for NH3 production because the reaction can be carried out under ambient conditions, and the electricity required to drive the reaction can be generated from renewable resources. In this work, an NRR catalyst based on Ir doped with Mo was modeled using density functional theory calculations, and the effect of the degree of doping on the catalytic activity was investigated. We found that the Ir(100) surface doped with a single Mo atom and that doped with two adjacent Mo atoms (Mo@Ir(100) and Mo@Ir(100)-ortho, respectively) exhibit the best NRR catalytic activities, having free energy barriers of 0.54 and 0.57 eV, respectively. In addition, by comparing the strength of adsorption of N2 and H on the active sites, we found that the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction could be inhibited. These results suggest that Mo@Ir(100) and Mo@Ir(100)-ortho are promising NRR catalysts for use under ambient conditions.",Materials Today Communications
Interface-engineered MoS2/CoS/NF bifunctional catalysts for highly-efficient water electrolysis,"© 2022 Science Press and Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of SciencesThe utilization of non-noble metal catalysts with robust and highly efficient electrocatalytic activity for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are extremely important for the large-scale implementation of renewable energy devices. Integration of bifunctional electrocatalysts on both anode and cathode electrodes remains a significant challenge. Herein, we report on a novel and facile strategy to construct the ordered and aligned MoS2 nanosheet-encapsulated metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) derived hollow CoS polyhedron, in-situ grown on a nickel foam (NF). The starfish-like MoS2/CoS/NF heterojunctions were formed due to the ordered growth of the material caused by NF substrate. The optimized 2-MoS2/CoS/NF heterojunction exhibits robust bifunctional electrocatalytic activity with a low overpotential of 67 and 207 mV toward the HER and OER at 10 mA cm−2, and the long-term stability, which exceeds most of the reported bifunctional electrocatalysts. Such high electrocatalytic performance arises due to the synergistic effect between the MoS2 and CoS phases across the interface, the abundant active sites, as well as the hierarchical pore framework, which collectively enhance the mass and electron transfer during the reactions. The work provides a promising approach to fabricating bifunctional catalysts with custom-designed heterojunctions and remarkable performance for applications in electrochemical energy devices and related areas.",Journal of Energy Chemistry

Significantly, Ni-Ti2B2O2, Cu-Ti2B2O2, Ni-Mo2B2O2, Ni-W2B2O2 and Pt-W2O2B2 exhibit promising ORR catalytic activity with low overpotential of 0.47 V, 0.57 V, 0.23 V, 0.43 V and 0.30 V, respectively, comparable to that of Pt (0.45 V). Meanwhile, Fe-Ti2B2O2, Co-Ti2B2O2, Fe-Mo2B2O2, Co-Mo2B2O2, Ni-Mo2B2O2, Fe-W2B2O2 and Co-W2B2O2 are promising OER catalysts with low overpotential of 0.51 V, 0.46 V, 0.48 V, 0.41 V, 0.54 V, 0.58 V and 0.30 V, respectively, comparable to that of RuO2 (0.42 V) and IrO2 (0.56 V). More importantly, ICOHP was used as a descriptor of ORR and OER catalytic activity in our work and shows good guidance for the further design of ORR, OER catalysts with high catalytic activity.",Applied Surface Science
Wood-derived biochar as thick electrodes for high-rate performance supercapacitors,"© 2022, The Author(s).Developing effective electrodes with commercial-level active mass-loading (> 10 mg cm−2) is vital for the practical application of supercapacitors. However, high active mass-loading usually requires thick active mass layer, which severely hinders the ion/electron transport and results in poor capacitive performance. Herein, a self-standing biochar electrode with active mass-loading of ca. 40 mg cm−2 and thickness of 800 µm has been developed from basswood. The basswood was treated with formamide to incorporate N/O in the carbon structure, followed by mild KOH activation to ameliorate the pore size and introduce more O species in the carbon matrix. The as-prepared carbon monoliths possess well conductive carbon skeleton, abundant N/O dopant and 3D porous structure, which are favorable for the ion/electron transport and promoting capacitance performance. The self-standing carbon electrode not only exhibits the maximum areal/mass/volumetric specific capacitance of 5037.5 mF cm−2/172.5 F g−1/63.0 F cm−3 at 2 mA cm−2 (0.05 A g−1), but also displays excellent rate performance with 76% capacitance retention at 500 mA cm−2 (12.5 A g−1) in a symmetric supercapacitor, surpassing the state-of-art biomass-based thick carbon electrode. The assembled model can power typical electron devices including a fan, a digital watch and a logo made up of 34 light-emitting diodes for a proper period, revealing its practical application potential. This study not only puts forward a commercial-level high active mass-loading electrode from biomass for supercapacitor, but also bridges the gap between the experimental research and practical application.

Topical advancements in electrochemical and optical signal amplification for biomolecules detection: A comparison,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdTechniques that detect multiple classes of biomarkers from biological samples are critical for applications ranging from precise disease diagnosis to decoding complex life processes. Because of the differences in target detection, instrumentation, and signal transduction, it is theoretically difficult to simplify a single recognition system to a wide range of targets. Herein, we comprehensively outline the topical improvements in eminent biomarkers detection based on optical and electrochemical sensing approaches. Following the introduction, we explicitly highlight different types of electrochemical and optical sensors, a range of these sensing platforms for the development of solid sensory interfaces, their characterization, working mechanism, and analytical performance. Clinically related endogenic small biomolecules discussed here includes neurotransmitters, metabolites, cancer biomarkers, nucleic acids, proteins, enzymes, and so on. We reviewed numerous approaches used for the careful determination of biomolecules, including (a) the use of conducting materials modified electrode with electrocatalytical activity to improve the response signal and to reduce interference from coexisting biological species, (b) the use of biorecognition elements like antibodies, aptamers, enzymes, enzyme-mimicking metalloproteins, biological receptors, co-enzymes, affinity ligands, nucleic acid, DNAzymes, and whole cells to realize specific determination, and (c) the combination of two approaches in a single experiment has also been discussed to expand the analytical signal amplification of biosensors. The detection of the diverse range of biomolecules for in vitro and in vivo analysis is also discussed. We further highlight the biosensor's proficiency in analyte detection in complex matrices or those constructed on novel nanoarchitectures.

Atomically Dispersed Iron Active Sites Promoting Reversible Redox Kinetics and Suppressing Shuttle Effect in Aluminum–Sulfur Batteries,"© 2022, The Author(s).Rechargeable aluminum–sulfur (Al–S) batteries have been considered as a highly potential energy storage system owing to the high theoretical capacity, good safety, abundant natural reserves, and low cost of Al and S. However, the research progress of Al–S batteries is limited by the slow kinetics and shuttle effect of soluble polysulfides intermediates. Herein, an interconnected free-standing interlayer of iron single atoms supported on porous nitrogen-doped carbon nanofibers (FeSAs-NCF) on the separator is developed and used as both catalyst and chemical barrier for Al–S batteries. The atomically dispersed iron active sites (Fe–N4) are clearly identified by aberration-corrected high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy and X-ray absorption near-edge structure. The Al–S battery with the FeSAs-NCF shows an improved specific capacity of 780 mAh g−1 and enhanced cycle stability. As evidenced by experimental and theoretical results, the atomically dispersed iron active centers on the separator can chemically adsorb the polysulfides and accelerate reaction kinetics to inhibit the shuttle effect and promote the reversible conversion between aluminum polysulfides, thus improving the electrochemical performance of the Al–S battery. This work provides a new way that can not only promote the conversion of aluminum sulfides but also suppress the shuttle effect in Al–S batteries.[Figure not available: see fulltext.]",Nano-Micro Letters
Exploring the roles of oxygen species in H2 oxidation at β-MnO2 surfaces using operando DRIFTS-MS,"© 2022, The Author(s).Understanding of the roles of oxygen species at reducible metal oxide surfaces under real oxidation conditions is important to improve the performance of these catalysts. The present study addresses this issue by applying a combination of operando diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy with a temperature-programmed reaction cell and mass spectrometry to explore the behaviors of oxygen species during H2 oxidation in a temperature range of 25–400 °C at β-MnO2 surfaces. It is revealed that O2 is dissociated simultaneously into terminal-type oxygen (M2+-O2–) and bridge-type oxygen (M+-O2–-M+) via adsorption at the Mn cation with an oxygen vacancy. O2 adsorption is inhibited if the Mn cation is covered with terminal-adsorbed species (O, OH, or H2O). In a temperature range of 110–150 °C, OH at Mn cation becomes reactive and its reaction product (H2O) can desorb from the Mn cation, resulting in the formation of bare Mn cation for O2 adsorption and dissociation. At a temperature above 150 °C, OH is reactive enough to leave bare Mn cation for O2 adsorption and dissociation. These results suggest that bare metal cations with oxygen vacancies are important to improve the performance of reducible metal oxide catalysts.",Communications Chemistry

Specially, among various Pd-based nanocatalysts, the 3D Pd-based nanocubes, endowed with large specific surface area, high structural stability, and favorable electric transmission capability have shown superb electrocatalytic performance for DAFC. So far, numerous researches, concerning the efficient synthesis, physicochemical characterization and electrocatalytic performance study about Pd-based nanocubes, have been widely reported. However, there is still lack of a comprehensive summary with regard to the universal synthesis strategies of Pd-based nanocubes and systematic analysis of the electrocatalytic ability enhancement. In this review, we firstly made an in-depth introduction of DAFC, mainly involving the two crucial half-reactions, namely, anodic alcohol oxidation reaction (AOR) and cathodic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Then, from the perspective of different physical morphologies of Pd-based nanocubes, the current synthesis pathways were generalized as the co-reduction approach, seed-mediated method, galvanic replacement and chemical etching, and meanwhile, the Pd-based nanocubes could also be classified as homogeneous, mesoporous, core–shell, hollow and concave nanocubes. In addition, some advanced strategies for electrocatalytic performance enhancement were further highlighted, which mainly included rich active sites, rational composition regulation, key facet control and efficient strain effect. Furthermore, the opportunities and challenges were also overviewed to provide guidance for the efficient synthesis and application of 3D Pd-based nanocubes in electrocatalytic field.",Coordination Chemistry Reviews

In this work, the influences of the second metal M type and local coordination environment in the N-doped graphene anchored RuM diatomic catalysts on C2H2 hydrochlorination activity were unraveled. The results showed that the metal M type and local coordination environment (N6V4 and N8V4) of RuM diatomic catalysts effectively regulate C2H2 hydrochlorination activity, attributing to the unique electronic properties of diatomic active sites caused by the metal M type and local coordination environment. Among sixteen types of RuM diatomic catalysts considered, five types of low-cost RuSn-N6V4, RuCo-N6V4, RuCu-N6V4, RuAu-N8V4 and RuCo-N8V4 catalysts were screened out to exhibit excellent C2H2 hydrochlorination activity, and AIMD simulations further confirmed better thermal stability of these five catalysts at 453 K. These predication needs to be checked via further experiments. This work identifies the role of the coordination environment and the type of active metal for N-doped graphene supported RuM diatomic catalysts in regulating C2H2 hydrochlorination activity, and helps rational design of high-performance and low-cost RuM diatomic catalysts by tuning the local coordination environment and the types of the second metal M.",Applied Surface Science

Incorporation of single-atom copper into nitrogen-doped graphene for acetaminophen electrocatalytic degradation,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Acetaminophen (APAP), as a pharmaceutical contaminant, can be degrade by electrocatalysis. However, the anode material is the main factor for electrocatalysis. Taking synergistic advantages of metal and graphene catalysts as anode is an effective way to improve the efficiency of electrocatalysis. Combining single metal atoms with graphene to maximize atom utilization efficiency of metal active center remains a challenge. This research fabricates single-atom copper (Cu) and nitrogen (N) atom-codoped graphene (1Cu@NG) as electrocatalytic anode. A series of characterizations disclose that the incorporation of N could be used as an anchor site for single-atom Cu, and the activity and stability of 1Cu@NG are optimized by interfacial interaction between single-atom Cu and N-doped graphene (NG). In 10 mg/L APAP with 1 g/L NaCl, the degradation efficiency of 1Cu@NG is 100 % within 90 min at current of 15 mA and leaching amounts of Cu ion is < 0.05 mg/L. The degradation efficiency of 1Cu@NG after four cycles is 97.13 % in 90 min and still maintain low ion leaching amounts (<0.05 mg/L). The main active substances produced by 1Cu@NG in the electrocatalytic degradation process are O2•− and active chlorine.

Synthesis of Mo-doped NiFe-phosphate hollow bird-nest architecture for efficient and stable seawater electrolysis,"© 2022Seawater electrolysis achieves sustainable hydrogen production and seawater desalination in the context of the scarcity of freshwater resources, achieving two birds with one stone. In this study, we reported an Mo-doped NiFe-phosphate hollow bird-nest architecture consisting of porous nanosheets on NiFe-foam (Mo-NiFe-PO3/NFF) as an admired bifunctional electrocatalyst for overall seawater splitting. The introduction of Mo distorted the crystal structure of NiFe-phosphate, regulated the electronic environment around the Ni/Fe, and improved the electrocatalytic activity. Moreover, it also cooperated with phosphate polyanions to resist the Cl− from seawater and enhanced the corrosion resistance. The Mo-NiFe-PO3/NFF exhibited outstanding electrocatalytic performance for alkaline seawater electrolysis under a two-electrode system where only required 1.65 V voltage to drive 100 mA cm−2. Particularly, the electrolyzer afforded industrially current density up to 500 mA cm−2 at a low voltage of 1.78 V, which were responsible for excellent durability up to 100 h. The bifunctional electrocatalyst in this study not only possessed high catalytic activity, but also effectively resisted the corrosion of Cl− in seawater.",Applied Surface Science
Heteroatom doping effect of Pt/rGO catalysts for formaldehyde abatement at ambient temperature,"© 2022 The AuthorsThe effect of doping with different heteroatoms (N, P, S, and F atoms) on physicochemical properties of reduced graphene oxide (rGO) catalysts and their performances on formaldehyde (HCHO) oxidation is investigated in this study. Nitrogen-doped rGO with a loading of 1 wt% Pt (Pt/N-rGO) sample exhibits a superior HCHO conversion of 82% at a gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) of 50,000 mL/(g × h) at ambient temperature. In addition, the Pt/N-rGO catalyst remained an outstanding activity and stability at room temperature after testing continuously for 48 h. A series of characterization results showed that nitrogen-doping significantly increased the defect degree and specific surface area of rGO compared with rGOs doped with other heteroatoms, promoted the dispersion of Pt nanoparticles (NPs), and produced more zero-valent Pt (Pt0). In addition, the average particle size of the Pt NPs in the samples doping with heteroatoms decreased from 36.4 nm to 4.4 nm. Combined with the results of HCHO-DRIFTS, the highly dispersed Pt NPs on the surface of Pt/N-rGO sample was conducive to activate oxygens and further transfer the formate intermediate.",Chemical Physics Impact
Metal-supported cathodically activated graphite via self-reduction as electrocatalysts for efficient hydrogen evolution reaction,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdSurface modification is a promising approach to modulate the electrocatalyst properties for their further use in energy storage and conversion. In this work, electrochemical-based approach was proposed to generate metallic particles-supported graphite rod (GR). The approach is based on the cathodic activation of GR in the presence of alkali metal salts in dry organic solvent. The activated GR possess a high reducing power that was successfully employed to spontaneously reduce metallic salts in aqueous media. The surface analyses confirm the formation of metallic nanoparticles supported GR. Interestingly, the metallic nanoparticles were found to be generated onto and intercalated into the GR. Next, the generated materials were used as electrocatalyst to drive the hydrogen evolution reaction. Our results demonstrate that the electrocatalytic performances depend on various parameters including the radius of the alkali metal cation and the injected charge during the electrochemical activation. The as-prepared Pt/Li-GR exhibits the best electrochemical activity and stability toward the hydrogen evolution reaction. The necessary overpotential value to reach a current density of 10 mA cm−2 is 40 mV for the Pt/Li-GR, and almost negligible overpotential change is observed during the stability tests. In addition, the proposed approach was successfully used to generate Pd/Li-GR catalyst. More impressively, the latter displays higher HER performances when compared to other reported Pd-based catalysts and comparable performance with commercial Pt/C catalyst.",Materials Today Chemistry

Photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting provides a promising technique for converting solar energy to sustainable hydrogen. Limited by the rate-determining oxygen evolution reaction (OER), the development of efficient photoanodes is crucial for overall PEC performance. Among the potential photoanode candidates, bismuth vanadate (BiVO4) has recently raised widespread attention owing to the suitable bandgap, cost-effectiveness, and chemical stability.

Surface reconstruction and sulfur vacancies engineering in pentlandite for improving hydrogen evolution reaction,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Transition metal sulfide pentlandite, (Fe, Ni)9S8, emerges as a prominent catalyst for electrolytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) owing to high conductivity and stability. In order to investigate the effect of sulfur (S) vacancy content on the HER activity of (Fe, Ni)9S8 for optimal HER activity, controlled levels of S vacancies need to be generated. Herein, Fe5Ni4S8−x electrocatalysts toward HER were developed through surface reconstruction and S vacancy engineering through a simple heat treatment method. The surface reconstruction could regulate the surface structure to be more stable and lead to a higher number of exposed active sites. S vacancies provided an Fe–Ni synergistic effect to facilitate the hydrogen adsorption, further improving catalytic activity. The optimal Fe5Ni4S8−x electrocatalyst exhibited the overpotential of 107 mV at 10 mA cm−2 in acidic media. Tafel slope and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy further demonstrate that the proposed thermal treatment to modulate the S vacancy content is a feasible approach to further accelerate the HER kinetics.

Structural evolution and strain generation of derived-Cu catalysts during CO2 electroreduction,"© 2022, The Author(s).Copper (Cu)-based catalysts generally exhibit high C2+ selectivity during the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). However, the origin of this selectivity and the influence of catalyst precursors on it are not fully understood. We combine operando X-ray diffraction and operando Raman spectroscopy to monitor the structural and compositional evolution of three Cu precursors during the CO2RR. The results indicate that despite different kinetics, all three precursors are completely reduced to Cu(0) with similar grain sizes (~11 nm), and that oxidized Cu species are not involved in the CO2RR. Furthermore, Cu(OH)2- and Cu2(OH)2CO3-derived Cu exhibit considerable tensile strain (0.43%~0.55%), whereas CuO-derived Cu does not. Theoretical calculations suggest that the tensile strain in Cu lattice is conducive to promoting CO2RR, which is consistent with experimental observations. The high CO2RR performance of some derived Cu catalysts is attributed to the combined effect of the small grain size and lattice strain, both originating from the in situ electroreduction of precursors. These findings establish correlations between Cu precursors, lattice strains, and catalytic behaviors, demonstrating the unique ability of operando characterization in studying electrochemical processes.",Nature Communications

Especially, two-dimensional (2D) MOFs with ultra-thin structure provide more active sites and shorter diffusion distance for heterogeneous catalytic reactions. However, the poor conductivity and poor stability of 2D MOFs impede their practical electrocatalytic applications greatly. Therefore, 2D MOF-derived transition metal carbides, sulfides, phosphides, oxides, and single-atom catalysts have been fabricated by carbonization, vulcanization, phosphorization or oxidation strategies, which improve the conductivity and stability significantly.

Herein, we investigate the electronic property and Schottky barrier of graphene/GeN3 vdW heterostructure by first-principles calculations. It is noted that the electronic natures of graphene and GeN3 monolayers are well preserved in the heterostructure lattice due to the weak vdW interaction. Interestingly, the p-type Schottky contact in graphene/GeN3 heterostructure with a barrier height of 0.21 eV can be effectively tuned by both vertical and horizontal strains.

Effect of water content and side chain on hydroxide transport in quaternary ammonium functionalized covalent organic frameworks as anion exchange membranes,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Covalent organic framework (COF) is an excellent candidate of ion transport material for its outstanding properties, yet the correlation between the structures and ion transport in COF is still to be clarified. Here we systematically investigate the effect of water content and side chain on the diffusion of hydroxide in several COFs functionalized with quaternary ammonium (QA) groups via molecular dynamics simulations. The water uptakes of the systems are determined by computing the adsorption isotherm curves at different water fugacity. Different from the previous assumption, we find that the length of the side chain does not change the radius of the channel, which consequently has little impact on the diffusion of hydroxide either. Instead, hydroxide diffusion is mainly determined by the strength of association between the cations and anions. Moving the QA groups from the side chain to the aromatic ring on the framework of the COF dramatically reduces hydroxide diffusion, which is attributed to the significantly enhanced association. Removing a fraction of tethers reduces hydroxide diffusion probably due to the broken of regularity of the hopping sites for the anions. Those results shed light on the interplay between several key parameters and the anion diffusion in the COF-based anion exchange membranes, which provide guidance for the future design.",Applied Surface Science
Wood-derived porous carbon supported γ-Fe2O3 nanoparticles as efficient catalyst for oxygen reduction reaction,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.The sluggish kinetics of oxygen reduction reaction at the cathode is one of the obstacles of the next-generation energy conversion system such as fuel cell and Zn-air battery. Here, a simple pyrolysis method was used to transform delignification-treated balsa wood into nitrogen-doped porous layered carbon materials. γ-Fe2O3 nanocrystals were supported on N-doped wood-derived carbon materials. The prepared Fe2O3-CW1000 catalyst exhibits superior ORR performance with a high onset potential of 0.98 VRHE in alkaline environment. This is consistent with the potential of commercial Pt/C. The superior ORR activity is attributed to the fact that γ-Fe2O3 nanoparticles promote the activity of Fe-Nx sites. And the N-enriched porous carbon matrix facilitates the faster electron movement on the catalyst surface and the full exposure of the active sites.",Applied Surface Science

It is indispensable to realize the apt functionalization and modification of COFs, mainly by introducing the heteroatoms to their copious pores and distinct structures. Herein, we designed nitrogenated COFs (N-COFs) with well-ordered nanopores and nitrogen-atoms, using density functional theory (DFT) and experiments. The N-COFs provided a uniquely coordinated environment for a single cobalt atom anchored between two nitrogen-atoms, which enables efficient CO2-reduction to formic-acid. In N-COFs catalyst, the N-atoms network is covalently linked to the carbonic-framework, providing the structure a crystalline nature. Moreover, N-COFs material is stable even at 1000 °C. DFT analysis revealed that the bandgap of Co-N-COF decreases to 0.67 eV owing to the synergistic effect of structural features and Co-coordination, while the bandgap of N-COF was 1.80 eV. The excellent catalytic-activity with formate partial current-densities ~446 mA cm−2, selectivity with highest Faradaic efficiency ~97.4%, and stability of 100 h was delivered by the synthesized catalyst.

"Electrochemical CO2 reduction over Pb electrodes modified with group 10, 11, and 14 elements","© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Surface modification method is a good strategy of improving electrocatalyst performance in CO2 reduction. Herein, lead (Pb) electrode was modified with groups 10 (Ni, Pd, and Pt), 11 (Cu, Ag, and Au), and 14 (Si, Ge, and Sn) elements, and their electrochemical CO2 reduction performances were tested under various conditions of applied potentials, electrolytes, and light irradiation conditions. Major products were observed to be formate and hydrogen and their Faradaic efficiencies were competitive reached to 71% and 28%, respectively. When H2 was increased formate was inversely decreased. Minor products of CO, acetone, and CH4 were mainly dependent on applied potentials and overlayer metals. Overlayer Pt, Pd, and Au metals were relatively stable on the Pb surface during amperometry while others were unstable on the surface.

Two-dimensional nickel–cobalt bimetallic hydroxides towards urea electrooxidation,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.The atom-thin metal-based two-dimensional (2D) nanomaterials have exhibited wide application in electrocatalysis because of their particular geometrical and electronic structures. Herein, we report a versatile and simple strategy to synthesize ultrathin nanosheets of nickel–cobalt bimetallic hydroxides (named as NiCo BMHs) through NaBH4 boosted cyanogel hydrolysis strategy. The hydrogen (H2) bubbles from the NaBH4 decomposition can effectively separate the 2D NiCo BMHs and avoid their self-stacking during the synthesis. As a result, NiCo BMHs with rich nanoholes possess only about 1.5 nm thickness, which results in a high surface area and rich defective atoms. The high surface area, rich edge active atoms, and synergistic effect between Ni2+ and Co2+/Co3+ species greatly improve the electrocatalytic activity of NiCo BMHs towards urea oxidation reaction (UOR). The potential of UOR at NiCo BMHs is only 1.33 V at 10 mA cm−2, much lower than that at various reported Ni-based nanomaterials, confirming the high electroactivity of NiCo BMHs.",Applied Surface Science
An extraordinary Na-S battery enabled by a carbon nanosheet host loaded with Fe-accelerator and TiO2-inhibitor,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.The inexpensive room-temperature sodium-sulfur (RT Na-S) battery has attracted extensive attention due to its various potential application but is still suffering from the low utilization of sulfur, the shuttle effect and the sluggish reaction activity of sodium polysulfides (SPSs). In this work, a TiO2/sulfur/atomic-iron loaded carbon nanosheet cathode is designed for high performance RT Na-S battery. When the atomic iron exists, a much higher electrochemical activity of sulfur was obtained, indicating the atomic iron can accelerate the conversion of SPSs. Furthermore, the TiO2 layer can inhibit the shuttle effect of SPSs and the side-reaction between the intermediates and carbonate electrolyte. As a result, the constructed sulfur cathode exhibits a high reversible capacity (569.9 mAh g−1 with an initial coulombic efficiency of 57.57%) at 0.1 A g−1 and outstanding cycling performance (507 mAh g−1 after 50 cycles). This work provides a new strategy for preparing high performance cathode materials for RT Na-S battery.",Applied Surface Science
Dispersion and stability mechanism of Pt nanoparticles on transition-metal oxides,"© 2022, The Author(s).The heterogeneous catalysts of Pt/transition-metal oxides are typically synthesized through calcination at 500 °C, and Pt nanoparticles are uniformly and highly dispersed when hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is applied before calcination. The influence of H2O2 on the dispersion and the stability of Pt nanoparticles on titania-incorporated fumed silica (Pt/Ti–FS) supports was examined using X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) measurements at the Pt L3 and Ti K edges as well as density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The local structural and chemical properties around Pt and Ti atoms of Pt/Ti–FS with and without H2O2 treatment were monitored using in-situ XAFS during heating from room temperature to 500 °C. XAFS revealed that the Pt nanoparticles of H2O2-Pt/Ti–FS are highly stable and that the Ti atoms of H2O2-Pt/Ti–FS support form into a distorted-anatase TiO2. DFT calculations showed that Pt atoms bond more stably to oxidized–TiO2 surfaces than they do to bare- and reduced–TiO2 surfaces. XAFS measurements and DFT calculations clarified that the presence of extra oxygen atoms due to the H2O2 treatment plays a critical role in the strong bonding of Pt atoms to TiO2 surfaces.",Scientific Reports
High current flux electrochemical sensor based on nickel-iron bimetal pyrolytic carbon material of paper waste pulp for clenbuterol detection,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.As a β-stimulant, clenbuterol (CLB) is abused to varying degrees by athletes worldwide. It is also used in the meat and dairy industries. CLB inadvertently enters the human body through the food chain, endangering human health. Therefore, a rapid and convenient method for detecting CLB is needed. In this study, nanocarbon-supported NiFe2O4 electrode materials (NiFe2O4–NPCs) were synthesized, and an electrochemical sensor (NiFe2O4–NPCs/GCE) for CLB detection was fabricated. NiFe2O4–NPCs have good electrical conductivity, electrocatalytic activity, and high electrical flux, owing to their large specific surface area and the anti-spinel structure of NiFe2O4. The fabricated sensor is an effective detector of CLB. The sensor exhibits linear ranges of 10−7–10−5 M and 7 × 10−11–10−7 M and a limit of detection (LOD) of 3.03 × 10−12 M (S/N = 3). The sensor also exhibits good sensitivities of 3.264 μA μM−1 cm−2 and 0.751 μA μM−1 cm−2 (S/N = 3). Additionally, NiFe2O4–NPCs/GCE successfully detected CLB in real samples of human urine. Thus, this study highlights the potential of the NiFe2O4–NPCs/GCE sensor for the detection of CLB in biological samples.",Talanta
Integration of plasmonic AgPd alloy nanoparticles with single-layer graphitic carbon nitride as Mott-Schottky junction toward photo-promoted H2 evolution,"© 2022, The Author(s).Plasmonic AgPd alloy nanoparticles (AgPdNPs) decorated on single-layer carbon nitride (AgPdNPs/SLCN) for the designing of the Mott-Schottky junction were constructed with the ultrasonically assisted hydrothermal method and used toward photo evolution H2 from formic acid (FA) at near room temperature (30 °C). The Pd atom contains active sites that are synergistically boosted by the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) effect of Ag atoms, leading to considerably enhanced photocatalytic properties. The photoactive AgPdNPs/SLCN obtained supreme catalytic activity to produce 50 mL of gas (H2 + CO2) with the initial turnover frequency of 224 h-1 under light irradiation. The catalyst showed stable catalytic performance during successive cycles.",Scientific Reports
In situ confined pyrolysis preparation of graphene-wrapped FePt nanoparticles anchored on N-doped hierarchically porous graphitic carbon nanoflakes for boosting oxygen reduction reaction,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Development of high-efficiency and stable electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is significant for commercial manufacturing of fuel cells. Herein, graphene-wrapped FePt alloyed nanoparticles anchored on N-doped hierarchically porous graphitic carbon nanoflakes (G-FePt@N-GCFs) were prepared by confined pyrolysis of the mixed metal precursors and dicyandiamide. Notably, dicyandiamide in situ polymerized to graphitic carbon nitride to further adsorb and confine metal ions, finally harvesting graphene-wrapped FePt nanoparticles under high temperature, accompanied by forming the N-doped graphitic carbon nanoflakes. The controlled experiments substantiate significance of the pyrolysis temperature and metal types. The resultant G-FePt@N-GCFs showed appealing ORR activity (Eonset = 1.01 V; E1/2 = 0.86 V vs. RHE), and durability (E1/2 negatively shifts for 12 mV within 2000 cycles), outperforming commercial Pt/C catalyst in the alkaline environment. This study provides some valuable guidelines for construction of state-of-art transition-metal-based carbon catalysts in energy storage and conversion devices.",Applied Surface Science
Boron induced strong metal-support interaction for high sintering resistance of Pt-based catalysts toward oxygen reduction reaction,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Insufficient thermal and electrochemical stability is a large challenge for carbon-supported Pt-based nanoparticles (NPs) as oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalysts. Herein, a facile pyrolysis method is developed for the synthesis of ultrasmall Pt NPs anchored on boron-doped carbon (Pt/(B-C)). The stronger interaction between Pt and boron-doped carbon (B-C) endows catalysts with improved sintering resistance to stabilize the Pt NPs of sub-3 nm up to 700 °C. The Pt/(B-C)600 catalyst presents a mass activity (MA) of 0.30 A mgPt−1, which is 3 times that of commercial Pt/C (0.10 A mgPt−1). After durability test, the MA of the Pt/(B-C)600 catalyst has only decreased by 19.7% (commercial Pt/C dropped by 58.7%). This method can also be extended to prepare B-C supported Pt alloy NPs (PtM/(B-C), M = Co, Fe, Ni, Cu), which exhibit superior ORR performance. This study provides a general strategy for the synthesis of thermally and electrochemically stable carbon supported Pt-based catalysts.",Applied Surface Science

The development of novel photo- and electrocatalysts significantly depends on synthetic techniques that facilitate the production of tailored advanced nanomaterials. The emerging use of pulsed laser in liquid synthesis has attracted immense interest as an effective synthetic technology with several advantages over conventional chemical and physical synthetic routes, including the fine-tuning of size, composition, surface, and crystalline structures, and defect densities and is associated with the catalytic, electronic, thermal, optical, and mechanical properties of the produced nanomaterials.

Insights into the activity of nickel boride/nickel heterostructures for efficient methanol electrooxidation,"© 2022, The Author(s).Designing efficient catalysts and understanding the underlying mechanisms for anodic nucleophile electrooxidation are central to the advancement of electrochemically-driven technologies. Here, a heterostructure of nickel boride/nickel catalyst is developed to enable methanol electrooxidation into formate with a Faradaic efficiency of nearly 100%. Operando electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and in situ Raman spectroscopy are applied to understand the influence of methanol concentration in the methanol oxidation reaction. High concentrations of methanol inhibit the phase transition of the electrocatalyst to high-valent electro-oxidation products, and electrophilic oxygen species (O* or OH*) formed on the electrocatalyst are considered to be the catalytically active species. Additional mechanistic investigation with density functional theory calculations reveals that the potential-determining step, the formation of *CH2O, occurs most favorably on the nickel boride/nickel heterostructure rather than on nickel boride and nickel. These results are highly instructive for the study of other nucleophile-based approaches to electrooxidation reactions and organic electrosynthesis.",Nature Communications
Selective electrochemical reduction of CO2 on compositionally variant bimetallic Cu–Zn electrocatalysts derived from scrap brass alloys,"© 2022, The Author(s).The electrocatalytic reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2RR) into value-added fuels is a promising initiative to overcome the adverse effects of CO2 on climate change. Most electrocatalysts studied, however, overlook the harmful mining practices used to extract these catalysts in pursuit of achieving high-performance. Repurposing scrap metals to use as alternative electrocatalysts would thus hold high privilege even at the compromise of high performance. In this work, we demonstrated the repurposing of scrap brass alloys with different Zn content for the conversion of CO2 into carbon monoxide and formate. The scrap alloys were activated towards CO2RR via simple annealing in air and made more selective towards CO production through galvanic replacement with Ag. Upon galvanic replacement with Ag, the scrap brass-based electrocatalysts showed enhanced current density for CO production with better selectivity towards the formation of CO. The density functional theory (DFT) calculations were used to elucidate the potential mechanism and selectivity of the scrap brass catalysts towards CO2RR. The d-band center in the different brass samples with different Zn content was elucidated.",Scientific Reports
MOF-derived Co/Co3O4/C hollow structural composite as an efficient electrocatalyst for hydrogen evolution reaction,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdStable, efficient catalysts are crucial for electrochemical water splitting. Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) can be used to create electrocatalysts meeting these criteria; however, the lack of high-quality electrode materials for the hydrogen evolution reaction impedes their adoption. In this study, a hollow-structured Co/Co3O4/C composite was prepared using a Co-based MOF precursor through a two-step pyrolysis-oxidation process. This composite outperformed nonhollow Co/Co3O4/C structures as well as hollow Co/C and Co3O4/C composites as a catalyst for hydrogen production in alkaline media. It had a low overvoltage of 169 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm−2 and a moderate Tafel slope of 60.7 mV dec-1. Moreover, it exhibited remarkable durability with 2000 cycles and 12 h of testing. This can be attributed to the synergistic effect of Co, Co3O4, and the hollow morphological architecture, which promote the dissociation of HO–H bonds, recombination of hydrogen intermediates, and efficient electron transfer. The results of this study are highly promising for the fabrication of cost-effective electrode materials for water splitting.",Fuel
Nesting of multiple polyhedral plasmonic nanoframes into a single entity,"© 2022, The Author(s).The development of plasmonic nanostructures with intricate nanoframe morphologies has attracted considerable interest for improving catalytic and optical properties. However, arranging multiple nanoframes in one nanostructure especially, in a solution phase remains a great challenge. Herein, we show complex nanoparticles by embedding various shapes of three-dimensional polyhedral nanoframes within a single entity through rationally designed synthetic pathways. This synthetic strategy is based on the selective deposition of platinum atoms on high surface energy facets and subsequent growth into solid platonic nanoparticles, followed by the etching of inner Au domains, leaving complex nanoframes. Our synthetic routes are rationally designed and executable on-demand with a high structural controllability. Diverse Au solid nanostructures (octahedra, truncated octahedra, cuboctahedra, and cubes) evolved into complex multi-layered nanoframes with different numbers/shapes/sizes of internal nanoframes. After coating the surface of the nanoframes with plasmonically active metal (like Ag), the materials exhibited highly enhanced electromagnetic near-field focusing embedded within the internal complicated rim architecture.",Nature Communications
Layered graphene/hexagonal boron nitride nanosheets (Gr/h-BNNs) applied to the CO2 photoconversion into methanol,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdPhotocatalysts based on heterostructure 2D materials show promising properties for the construction of optoelectronic devices for selective reduction of CO2 to methanol. In this sense, a fast and simple method to produce 2D hexagonal hybrid BN nanosheets (h-BNNs) doped with graphene heterostructure by van der Waals interactions was developed. The method used plasma created by a Tesla coil. The Gr/h-BNNs hybrid material obtained presented a stacking structure containing h-BNNs and graphene layers. The structure included doping of carbon atoms along the h-BN edge structures. The doping of the h-BN nanostructure with graphene sheets, conferred adaptable optical properties to the semiconductor, resulting in band gap energy values favorable to photocatalysis. The reaction promoted selective reduction of CO2 to methanol, and synthesis of other products, such as formaldehyde and formic acid, due to multielectronic transfer processes.",Applied Materials Today
Hierarchical macro-mesoporous electrocatalysts with dual-active sites of Ru single atoms and monodispersed Ru–Mo nanoclusters for efficient hydrogen evolution,"© 2022Rationally designing high-performance electrocatalysts with high density and multiactive sites is an effective strategy to accelerate the alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) kinetics, yet it remains challenging. Herein, a catalyst comprising numerous Ru–Mo-based single atoms and subnanoclusters incorporated into a hierarchical macro-mesoporous carbon framework with a P-doped skeleton (Ru–Mo/PC) was successfully developed via a simple template-assisted pyrolysis method. Spherical aberration correction electron microscopy and X-ray absorption fine structure measurements revealed that the dual-active sites consisted of Ru–C5 single atoms and ultrasmall Ru–Mo nanoclusters (mean diameter of 0.94 nm). In particular, the as-constructed RuMo1.5/PC catalyst exhibited a high activity towards the HER, requiring an overpotential of only 17.9 mV at 10 mA/cm2, which outperformed a commercial Pt/C catalyst in alkaline media. Electrochemical performance results also indicated that introducing moderate Mo species played a crucial role in further boosting the HER activity compared to Ru/PC. The present work provides a step forward in designing efficient and stable catalysts with high-density, atomically dispersed active sites for hydrogen production.",Materials Today Chemistry
Electronic structure factors and the importance of adsorbate effects in chemisorption on surface alloys,"© 2022, The Author(s).The chemisorption energy is an integral aspect of surface chemistry, central to numerous fields such as catalysis, corrosion, and nanotechnology. Electronic-structure-based methods such as the Newns-Anderson model are therefore of great importance in guiding the engineering of material surfaces with optimal properties. However, existing methods are inadequate for interpreting complex, multi-metallic systems. Herein, we introduce a physics-based chemisorption model for alloyed transition metal surfaces employing primarily metal d-band properties that accounts for perturbations in both the substrate and adsorbate electronic states upon interaction. Importantly, we show that adsorbate-induced changes in the adsorption site interact with its chemical environment leading to a second-order response in chemisorption energy with the d-filling of the neighboring atoms. We demonstrate the robustness of the model on a wide range of transition metal alloys with O, N, CH, and Li adsorbates yielding a mean absolute error of 0.13 eV versus density functional theory reference chemisorption energies.",npj Computational Materials
Quantum Dots Compete at the Acme of MXene Family for the Optimal Catalysis,"© 2022, The Author(s).It is well known that two-dimensional (2D) MXene-derived quantum dots (MQDs) inherit the excellent physicochemical properties of the parental MXenes, as a Chinese proverb says, “Indigo blue is extracted from the indigo plant, but is bluer than the plant it comes from.” Therefore, 0D QDs harvest larger surface-to-volume ratio, outstanding optical properties, and vigorous quantum confinement effect. Currently, MQDs trigger enormous research enthusiasm as an emerging star of functional materials applied to physics, chemistry, biology, energy conversion, and storage. Since the surface properties of small-sized MQDs include the type of surface functional groups, the functionalized surface directly determines their performance. As the Nobel Laureate Wolfgang Pauli says, “God made the bulk, but the surface was invented by the devil,” and it is just on the basis of the abundant surface functional groups, there is lots of space to be thereof excavated from MQDs. We are witnessing such excellence and even more promising to be expected. Nowadays, MQDs have been widely applied to catalysis, whereas the related reviews are rarely reported. Herein, we provide a state-of-the-art overview of MQDs in catalysis over the past five years, ranging from the origin and development of MQDs, synthetic routes of MQDs, and functionalized MQDs to advanced characterization techniques. To explore the diversity of catalytic application and perspectives of MQDs, our review will stimulate more efforts toward the synthesis of optimal MQDs and thereof designing high-performance MQDs-based catalysts.[Figure not available: see fulltext.].",Nano-Micro Letters
Main-group metal elements as promising active centers for single-atom catalyst toward nitric oxide reduction reaction,"© 2022, The Author(s).Current research efforts on single-atom catalysts (SACs) exclusively focus on nonmetal or transition-metal atoms as active centers, while employing main-group metal elements is seemingly excluded because their delocalized s/p-bands are prone to yield a broadened resonance for the interaction with adsorbates. Here, we use high-throughput first-principles calculations to investigate the possible incorporation of Mg, Al, and Ga to form graphene-based SACs for NO reduction reaction (NORR) toward NH3. 51 SAC candidates with different metal coordination environments have been computationally screened employing a rationally designed four-step process, yielding six SACs with high catalytic activity and NORR selectivity. The performance is rationalized by the modulation of s/p-band filling of the main-group metals. The adsorption free energy of NO is identified as an efficient descriptor for such SACs. The underlying physical mechanism is revealed and generally applicable to other main group metal SACs. These fundamental insights extend NORR SACs to main-group metal elements.",npj 2D Materials and Applications
Heteronanostructural metal oxide-based gas microsensors,"© 2022, The Author(s).The development of high-performance, portable and miniaturized gas sensors has aroused increasing interest in the fields of environmental monitoring, security, medical diagnosis, and agriculture. Among different detection tools, metal oxide semiconductor (MOS)-based chemiresistive gas sensors are the most popular choice in commercial applications and have the advantages of high stability, low cost, and high sensitivity. One of the most important ways to further enhance the sensor performance is to construct MOS-based nanoscale heterojunctions (heteronanostructural MOSs) from MOS nanomaterials. However, the sensing mechanism of heteronanostructural MOS-based sensors is different from that of single MOS-based gas sensors in that it is fairly complex. The performance of the sensors is influenced by various parameters, including the physical and chemical properties of the sensing materials (e.g., grain size, density of defects, and oxygen vacancies of materials), working temperatures, and device structures. This review introduces several concepts in the design of high-performance gas sensors by analyzing the sensing mechanism of heteronanostructural MOS-based sensors. In addition, the influence of the geometric device structure determined by the interconnection between the sensing materials and the working electrodes is discussed. To systematically investigate the sensing behavior of the sensor, the general sensing mechanism of three typical types of geometric device structures based on different heteronanostructural materials are introduced and discussed in this review. This review will provide guidelines for readers studying the sensing mechanism of gas sensors and designing high-performance gas sensors in the future.

Regulating the spin state of single-atom doped covalent triazine frameworks for efficient nitrogen fixation,"© 2022 Elsevier Inc.Covalent triazine frameworks (CTFs), served as a versatile platform, can form expedient metal–N single-atom coordination sites as promising catalytic centers. To seek out excellent candidate catalysts of M/CTFs (M = Transition metal) for nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR), a “five-step” strategy involving spin states has been established for hierarchical high-throughput screening and reveals strong coordination ability of the CTFs, outstanding conductivity of the M/CTFs, effective adsorption and activation of N2* attributed to the electron transfer and orbital hybridization between the M/CTFs and N2*. Among the potential candidates, the Cr/CTF is screened out to be an excellent one for nitrogen fixation, which can not only inhibit hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) greatly but also has good thermodynamic stability (Eb = −4.40 eV), narrow band gap (Eg = 0.03 eV), moderate adsorption energy (Ea = −0.84 eV), large activation energy (ΔGN2* = −0.71 eV) and a theoretical Faradaic efficiency of 100%. The spin state has been confirmed to be an important descriptor of catalytic activity and the two-state reactivity (TSR) is validated to exist in the NRR. Reaction mechanism with different spin states of Cr/CTF has been demonstrated to give a great impact on the nitrogen fixation, providing solid theoretical support for the design of more efficient NRR catalysts.",Journal of Colloid and Interface Science
Synergy of heterojunction and interfacial strain for boosting photocatalytic H2 evolution of black phosphorus nanosheets,"© 2022 Elsevier Inc.As an emerging post-graphene two-dimensional material, black phosphorus (BP) has attracted enormous interest as a promising cocatalyst for photocatalytic hydrogen (H2) evolution, however, the activity of either pristine bulk or BP nanosheets is far from satisfactory. Herein, we present an effective strategy to greatly boost the H2 evolution performance of BP via applying the synergistic effect of heterojunction and interfacial lattice strain. A multilayered heterostructure coupling BP nanosheets and nickel oxide (NiO) nanosheets with abundant interface P-Ni and P–O bonds is synthesized and utilized as a proof-of-concept material for our design. Both the experimental and theoretical results have revealed that the strain is formed in BP-NiO multilayered heterostructure. The generated lattice strain induces the charge redistribution at the interface between BP and NiO, which leads to the improved electron transfer efficiency and favorable H* adsorption kinetics for photocatalytic H2 evolution reaction. As a result, the BP-NiO heterostructure with strain effect exhibits much enhanced photocatalytic H2 evolution activity in the presence of Eosin Y (EY) as photosensitizer, exceeding that of zero-strained BP/NiO heterostructure and many other reported noble-metal-free cocatalyst.",Journal of Colloid and Interface Science
Oriented interlayered charge transfer in NiCoFe layered double hydroxide/MoO3 stacked heterostructure promoting the oxygen-evolving behavior,"© 2022 Elsevier Inc.Oxygen evolution reaction (OER), the rate-limiting half reaction of water electrolysis, plays as a crucial role in improving the overall efficiency of the coupled hydrogen evolution. To date, earth-abundant OER catalysts have been extensively studied, while unfortunately their catalytic activity and operational stability still need to be further optimized. In this work, we fabricated a highly efficient OER catalyst based on two-dimensional (2D) NiCoFe layered double hydroxide (LDH)/MoO3 stacked heterostructure with enriched active sites and optimal electronic structure via an electrostatic-driven self-assembly process. The rough surface of the 2D heterostructure could offer abundant reactive sites for the pre-oxidation reaction, thereby leading to fast generation of the high-valence active species for OER, and the multi-metal synergy and oriented interlayered charge transfer could further enhance the intrinsic OER activity, finally resulting in enhanced OER performance with low overpotential, large current density, high intrinsic activity and excellent operational stability.",Journal of Colloid and Interface Science
Increasing N active sites by in-situ growing conformal C3N4 layer in hierarchical porous carbon-based networks for fast Li+ transfer and polysulfide anchoring in lithium-sulfur batteries,"© 2022Various challenges remain to be overcome in lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries, including the volume expansion and low conductivity of sulfur, the shuttle effect of lithium polysulfides and the sluggish redox reaction in the cell. Herein, we propose a multilayered conductive framework by the in situ growth of a conformal graphene-like C3N4 (GCN) coating on porous CNT@NC networks with carbon nanotubes (CNTs) as the core and N-doped carbon (NC) as the crosslinking shell. The abundant N in the GCN coating increased the surface N concentration of the framework from 14.38% to 18.77%, which enriched the active sites in the frameworks for the adsorption and catalysis conversion of LiPSs and Li2S with a low energy barrier. Furthermore, the scalable frameworks can provide an 85% porosity for a sufficient reaction interface and accommodate the volume expansion of sulfur. The synergistic effect between GCN and the highly conductive hierarchical structure can accelerate the transport of Li+ and electrons as well as the diffusion of electrolyte. Benefitting from the above advantages, the Al-free CNT@NC@GCN electrode exhibits a reversible capacity of 647.6 mAh g−1 after cycling for 450 cycles at 1C with a low capacity fading rate of 0.09% per cycle. This proposed facile strategy creates inspiring insights into the design of novel cathode materials for Li-S batteries.",Journal of Colloid and Interface Science
Phase interface engineering of metal selenides heterostructure for enhanced lithium-ion storage and electrocatalysis,"© 2022Biphasic or multiphase heterostructures hold attractive prospects in engineering advanced electrode materials for energy-related applications owing to the appealing synergistic effect; however, they still suffer from unsatisfied electrochemical activity and reaction kinetics. Herein, guided by density functional theory calculation, a well-engineered selenides heterostructure with high-density Ni3Se4-NiSe2 biphasic interfaces that fastened in N, O-codoped carbon matrix, was developed for high-performance lithium storage and electrocatalysis. By controlled selenylation of metal–organic framework (MOF), a series of NiSex@C hybrids (Ni3Se4@C, Ni3Se4/NiSe2@C-1, Ni3Se4/NiSe2@C-2, and NiSe2@C) with tunable biphasic components and grain sizes were prepared. Abundant two-phase interfaces with higher interface density are generated inside the Ni3Se4/NiSe2-1 induced by much smaller nanograins in comparison with the Ni3Se4/NiSe2-2, so that significant charge redistribution and faster electrons/Li+ ions transfer kinetics are achieved within the selenides, which are proved by the mutual verification of experiment and theoretical analysis. Benefitting from this optimized heterointerfaces, the Ni3Se4/NiSe2@C-1 electrode manifests reduced polarization, superior rate capability, and prolonged cyclic stability (621.3 mAh g−1 at 1 A g−1 for 1000 cycles; 362.3 mAh g−1 at 4 A g−1 for 2000 cycles) with respect to the Ni3Se4/NiSe2@C-2, as well as excellent performance in LiCoO2//Ni3Se4/NiSe2@C-1 full cell. Detailed electrochemical analysis confirmed rapid electrons/Li+ diffusion rates and more pseudocapacitive energy for the Ni3Se4/NiSe2@C-1. Therefore, the Ni3Se4/NiSe2@C-1 showcases superior hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and lithium storage performance.

Optimizing electronic structure of porous Ni/MoO2 heterostructure to boost alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction,"© 2022 Elsevier Inc.Heterostructure engineering is an efficient strategy to synergistically improve electrocatalytic activity. In this work, Ni/MoO2 heterojunction nanorods with porous structure self-supported on nickel foam (NF) are elaborately designed through a facile solution-evaporation method followed by a thermal reduction process. Prominently, the optimal electrocatalyst Ni/MoO2@NF-E delivers an exceptionally low overpotential of 19 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm−2 and a small Tafel slope of 52.3 mV dec-1 toward the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alkaline solution. Concurrently, Ni/MoO2@NF-E also maintains excellent stability after 120 h of electrolysis or 5000 cyclic voltammetry cycles. The experimental and density functional theory (DFT) results indicate that the enhanced HER performance of Ni/MoO2@NF-E should be ascribed to the porous structure in the Ni/MoO2 nanorods providing more active catalytic site, the moderate Gibbs free energy of hydrogen adsorption (ΔGH*), as well as strong synergistic effect between Ni and MoO2. This work provides an efficient route for developing HER electrocatalysts in alkaline media.",Journal of Colloid and Interface Science
Manganese phosphorous trifulfide nanosheets and nitrogen doped carbon dot composites with manganese vacancies for a greatly enhanced hydrogen evolution,"© 2022 Elsevier Inc.As a novel chalcogenide photocatalyst, MnPS3 suffered from limited visible light absorption, high photogenerated electron-hole recombination, and low hole oxidation capability due to its high valence band (VB) potential. In this work, the novel MnPS3 nanosheets-Nitrogen-doped carbon dots (NCDs) composites were fabricated by immobilizing NCDs with terminal amine groups on Na+ intercalated MnPS3 nanosheets for a greatly enhanced photocatalytic hydrogen production activity. MnPS3 nanosheets of 400 nm with Mn2+ vacancies are produced in high yield by NaCl intercalation and subsequent exfoliation in N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP). NCDs with 5 nm are evenly loaded on the surface of MnPS3 nanosheets of 400 nm via strong chemical interactions of ammonium sulfate salts formed at the interface. The MnPS3-NCDs composites exhibit enhanced light absorption at 500–600 nm, reduced charge recombination and notably promoted photocatalytic activity in relative to neat MnPS3 nanosheets. MnPS3-NCDs composite with the NCDs content of 16.5% possessed the highest photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rate of 339.63 μmol·g−1·h−1 with good cycling stability, which is 9.17 times that of exfoliated MnPS3 nanosheets.

Ultra-dispersed copper nanoparticles constructing crystalline-amorphous interface sites for alkaline water splitting,"© 2022 Elsevier Inc.In literature, the creation of an interface between a highly conductive crystalline phase and an amorphous phase with unsaturated sites has been proven to be an effective strategy in the design of electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). However, the procedural complexity and limited formation of interfaces have compromised the envisioned effects. In this work, the dense crystalline Fe2O3/amorphous Cu interface was created simultaneously by the combination of solverthermal and annealing processes. The results showed that the ultra-dispersed Cu nanoparticles attributed to the formation of crystalline-amorphous (c-a) interface sites, which facilitated the electron transfer with the tuned electronic structures as well as the favorable adsorption of surface oxygen species. As a result, the developed Fe2O3/Cu-PNC catalyst outperformed most of the competing bifunctional catalysts reported for both OER and HER operations.",Journal of Colloid and Interface Science
Converting inert AlOOH into efficient electrocatalyst for oxygen evolution reaction via structural/electronic modulation,"© 2022 Elsevier Inc.Efficient and stable water-splitting electrocatalysts play a key role to obtain green and clean hydrogen energy. However, only a few kinds of materials display an intrinsically good performance towards water splitting. It is significant but challengeable to effectively improve the catalytic activity of inert or less active catalysts for water splitting. Herein, we present a structural/electronic modulation strategy to convert inert AlOOH nanorods into catalytic nanosheets for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) via ball milling, plasma etching and Co doping. Compared to inert AlOOH, the modulated AlOOH delivers much better OER performance with a low overpotential of 400 mV at 10 mA cm−2 and a very low Tafel slope of 52 mV dec-1, even lower than commercial OER catalyst RuO2. Significant performance enhancement is attributed to the electronic and structural modulation. The electronic structure is effectively improved by Co doping, ball milling-induced shear strain, plasma etching-caused rich vacancies; abrupt morphology/microstructure change from nanorod to nanoparticle to nanosheet, as well as rich defects caused by ball milling and plasma etching, can significantly increase active sites; the free energy change of the potential determining step of modulated AlOOH decreases from 2.93 eV to 1.70 eV, suggesting a smaller overpotential is needed to drive the OER processes. This strategy can be extended to improve the electrocatalytic performance for other materials with inert or less catalytic activity.",Journal of Colloid and Interface Science
Universitetet i Oslo-67 (UiO-67)/graphite oxide composites with high capacities of toluene: Synthesis strategy and adsorption mechanism insight,"© 2022 Elsevier Inc.In this paper, a simple solvothermal synthesis method was proposed for the preparation of metal organic framework/graphene oxide hybrid nanocomposite (UiO-67/GO). A series of UiO-67/GO composites were prepared by varying the addition forms and amounts of GO, and the optimal synthesis conditions were screened. The composites were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), transmission Electron Microscope (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic (XPS), water contact angles (CA) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The adsorption capacity and the adsorption process of toluene were investigated by dynamic adsorption and adsorption kinetics, respectively. The results indicated that 67/GO-0.5% reached the maximum adsorption capacity (876 mg g−1), which far exceeded the other adsorbents. Kinetic model and the Weber-Morris model correlated satisfactorily to the experimental data. The improved adsorption performance was attributed to GO, which enhanced π-π interaction, promoted defect generation and provided more adsorption sites. Finally, the excellent regeneration performance of the adsorbent was verified by temperature programmed desorption (TPD) and cyclic adsorption–desorption experiments. Moreover, the adsorption mechanism was further revealed. Combined with the related adsorption experiments and the density functional theory (DFT) analysis, the efficient removal of toluene by UiO-67/GO was attributed to the cooperation of defects, π-π interaction and hydrogen bonding.",Journal of Colloid and Interface Science
Rational coordination regulation in carbon-based single-metal-atom catalysts for electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction,"© 2022, The Author(s).Single-metal-atom catalysts (SMACs) have garnered extensive attention for various electrocatalytic applications, owing to their maximum atom-utilization efficiency, tunable electronic structure, and remarkable catalytic performance. In particular, carbon-based SMACs exhibit optimal electrocatalytic activity for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) which is of paramount importance for several sustainable energy conversion and generation technologies, such as fuel cells and metal-air batteries. Despite continuous endeavors in developing various advanced carbon-based SMACs for electrocatalytic ORR, the rational regulation of coordination structure and thus the electronic structure of carbon-based SMACs remains challenging. In this review, we critically examine the role of coordination structure, including local coordination structure (i.e., metal atomic centers and the first coordination shell) and extended local coordination structure (i.e., the second and higher coordination shells), on the rational design of carbon-based SMACs for high-efficiency electrocatalytic ORR. Insights into the relevance between coordination structures and their intrinsic ORR activities are emphatically exemplified and discussed. Finally, we also propose the major challenges and future perspectives in the rational design of advanced carbon-based SMACs for electrocatalytic ORR. This review aims to emphasize the significance of coordination structure and deepen the insightful understanding of structure-performance relationships.",Nano Convergence
Modulating the strong metal-support interaction of single-atom catalysts via vicinal structure decoration,"© 2022, The Author(s).Metal-support interaction predominately determines the electronic structure of metal atoms in single-atom catalysts (SACs), largely affecting their catalytic performance. However, directly tuning the metal-support interaction in oxide supported SACs remains challenging. Here, we report a new strategy to subtly regulate the strong covalent metal-support interaction (CMSI) of Pt/CoFe2O4 SACs by a simple water soaking treatment. Detailed studies reveal that the CMSI is weakened by the bonding of H+, generated from water dissociation, onto the interface of Pt-O-Fe, resulting in reduced charge transfer from metal to support and leading to an increase of C-H bond activation in CH4 combustion by more than 50 folds. This strategy is general and can be extended to other CMSI-existed metal-supported catalysts, providing a powerful tool to modulating the catalytic performance of SACs.",Nature Communications
Designing hierarchical iron doped nickel-vanadium hydroxide microsphere as an efficient electrocatalyst for oxygen evolution reaction,"© 2022Exploring highly active and inexpensive electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is considered to be one of the preconditions for the development of energy and environment-related technologies. Nickel-based layered double hydroxides (LDHs) are extensively-studied OER electrocatalysts, but they still require relatively high overpotentials to achieve threshold current densities. In this work, iron-doped nickel-vanadium hydroxide microspheres (Fe-doped NiV HMS) were synthesized by doping iron ions into the NiV HMS through a facile cation-exchange method. The Fe-doped NiV HMS are hollow hierarchical structure stacked by high-density perpendicularly-lying nanosheets, which provide enough space for electrolyte penetration and diffusion. Owing to optimized composition and hollow hierarchical structure, the Fe-doped NiV HMS exhibits excellent electrocatalytic performance, which possessed a very low running overpotential (255 mV at 10 mA cm−2) and a smallest Tafel slope (56 mV dec−1) compared with hierarchical NiV HMS toward OER. Electrochemical results and density functional theory (DFT) manifest that Fe doping could regulate the electronic structure of NiV HMS, thus improving its electrical conductivity and electron transfer rate, and thus enhancing its catalytic activity. This research provides a convenient way to prepare Ni-based hydroxides as promising OER catalysts.",Journal of Colloid and Interface Science
N-doped carbon anchored CoS2/MoS2 nanosheets as efficient electrocatalysts for overall water splitting,"© 2022, The Author(s).The oriented two-dimensional porous nitrogen-doped carbon embedded with CoS2 and MoS2 nanosheets is a highly efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst. The hierarchical structure ensures fast mass transfer capacity in improving the electrocatalytic activity. And the greatly increased specific surface area is beneficial to expose more electrocatalytically active atoms. For oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) tests in 1 mol/L KOH solution, only 194 and 140 mV overpotential are required to achieve a current density of 10 mA/cm2, respectively. Our research provides an effective strategy for synergizing the individual components in nanostructures for a wide range of electrocatalytic reactions.

Recent advance in metal- and covalent-organic framework-based photocatalysis for hydrogen evolution,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdThe development of highly efficient solar energy–driven photocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is critical to promoting hydrogen-powered technologies in the future. Metal organic frameworks (MOFs) and covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are a kind of crystal material with regular channels, ultra-high surface areas, and tunable chemical components, which provide fascinating functionalities in photocatalytic hydrogen production, by reducing reaction potentials, and accelerating reaction rates. Although some progresses have been gained in this field, basic issues remain to be solved to further comprehend the relationship between the structures, properties, and photocatalytic performance of MOF- and COF-based materials. Herein, the current state-of-the-art in the use of original MOFs and COFs, MOF- and COF-supported, and MOF-derived materials as photocatalysts to produce sustainable hydrogen energy are summarized. It begins with the principles of photocatalytic water splitting and the relevant factors to ascertain the catalytic activity. Following that, particular emphasis is placed in the novel strategies to enhance the photocatalytic performances. Furthermore, the structure−function correlation and applications of MOF- and COF-based photocatalysts are detailed in photocatalytic hydrogen production.

Two birds with one stone: innovative ceria-loaded gold@platinum nanospheres for photothermal-catalytic therapy of tumors,"© 2022 Elsevier Inc.Photothermal therapy (PTT) has been widely employed in tumor treatment due to the non-invasive, highly selective, and low toxic side effects. However, the limited penetration of laser couples with the metastasis and recurrence of tumors, thus failing to eliminate them. Here, we report that ceria-loaded gold@platinum (CeO2/Au@Pt) nanospheres modified with polyethylene glycol (PEG). exhibit dual enzymatic activities for photothermal-catalytic synergistic therapy of tumors. CeO2/Au@Pt nanospheres are constructed through the loading of ultra-small CeO2 into core–shell Au@Pt nanospheres. In such a construct, Au@Pt enables targeted PTT, thanks to exceptional photothermal properties, while CeO2 nanozymes alleviate tumor hypoxia and kill tumor cells by producing highly toxic hydroxyl radicals (·OH) based on catalase- and peroxidase-like activities. Synergistic photothermal-catalytic therapy is achieved by delivering nanozymes to the tumor microenvironment (TME) coupled with PTT. This photothermal-catalytic approach that combines simultaneous exogenous and endogenous activation is a potential option for tumor co-therapy.",Journal of Colloid and Interface Science
Dispersible CdS1−xSex solid-solution nanocrystal photocatalysts: Photoinduced self-transformation synthesis and enhanced hydrogen-evolution activity,"© 2022 Elsevier Inc.Modulating the electronic structure of Cadmium sulfide (CdS) by non-metallic elements to produce solid-solution photocatalysts serves as a potential route to improve its performance of photocatalytic hydrogen (H2) evolution. However, exploring an effective synthetic route of CdS-based solid solution is still a great challenge. Herein, the CdS1−xSex solid-solution nanocrystals were successfully synthesized by an accessible photoinduced self-transformation route, including the direct formation of dispersible CdS1−x(SeS)x and the in situ self-transformation of selenosulfide ((SeS)2−) to Se2− by photoexcited electrons. The prepared CdS1−xSex solid-solution photocatalysts possess a small crystallite size of ca. 5 nm and their bandgaps can be easily tuned in a wide range of 1.84–2.28 eV by tailoring the mole ratio of Se/S. The resultant CdS0.90Se0.10 solid-solution photocatalyst realizes the highest H2-production tempo of 94.6 μmol·h−1, which is 1.6 folds higher than that of CdS. The experimental and theoretical studies supported that the incorporation of Se atoms could not only narrow the bandgap value to reinforce visible-light absorption, but also tune its electronic structure to optimize interfacial H2-evolution dynamics, thus achieving an efficient photocatalytic H2-production rate of the dispersible CdS1−xSex solid solution. This study may deliver advanced inspirations for optimizing the electronic structure of photocatalysts towards sustainable H2 production.",Journal of Colloid and Interface Science
Facile fabrication of screen-printed MoS2 electrodes for electrochemical sensing of dopamine,"© 2022, The Author(s).Molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) screen-printed working electrodes were developed for dopamine (DA) electrochemical sensing. MoS2 working electrodes were prepared from high viscosity screen-printable inks containing various concentrations and sizes of MoS2 particles and ethylcellulose binder. Rheological properties of MoS2 inks and their suitability for screen-printing were analyzed by viscosity curve, screen-printing simulation and oscillatory modulus. MoS2 inks were screen-printed onto conductive FTO (Fluorine-doped Tin Oxide) substrates. Optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM/EDX) analysis were used to characterize the homogeneity, topography and thickness of the screen-printed MoS2 electrodes. The electrochemical performance was assessed through differential pulse voltammetry. Results showed an extensive linear detection of dopamine from 1 µM to 300 µM (R2 = 0.996, sensitivity of 5.00 × 10–8 A μM−1), with the best limit of detection being 246 nM. This work demonstrated the possibility of simple, low-cost and rapid preparation of high viscosity MoS2 ink and their use to produce screen-printed FTO/MoS2 electrodes for dopamine detection.",Scientific Reports
Porphyrinic MOF derived Single-atom electrocatalyst enables methanol oxidation,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Electrochemical methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) serves as a key route for renewable energy technologies. However, unmet challenges remain in the preparation of low-cost, efficient and robust electrocatalysts for MOR. Herein, a porphyrinic metal–organic framework (MOF) with spatially isolated Ni centres is prepared. Upon pyrolysis, this affords a single-atom Ni implanted nitrogen-doped porous carbon (20% Ni-N-C). Integrating abundant and accessible single-atom Ni sites, hierarchical porosity, excellent conductivity with stable Ni-N4 moieties all in one, the derived ultra-stable 20% Ni-N-C exhibits high MOR activity, impressive durability and CO tolerance, thereby outperforming state-of-the-art nonprecious metal based electrocatalysts. Computational insights reveal a low energy barrier of 1.19 eV for the rate-determining step, in agreement with the experimental observations of superior MOR activity. As the first foray into improving MOR efficiency with nonprecious metal based single-atom electrocatalysts, the yet-unrealized potential for MOFs and related modular hybrids is demonstrated.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Atomic-resolution structures from polycrystalline covalent organic frameworks with enhanced cryo-cRED,"© 2022, The Author(s).The pursuit of atomic precision structure of porous covalent organic frameworks (COFs) is the key to understanding the relationship between structures and properties, and further developing new materials with superior performance. Yet, a challenge of how to determine their atomic structures has always existed since the first COFs reported seventeen years ago. Here, we present a universal method for ab initio structure determination of polycrystalline three-dimensional (3D) COFs at atomic level using enhanced cryo-continuous rotation electron diffraction (cryo-cRED), which combines hierarchical cluster analysis with cryo-EM technique. The high-quality datasets possess not only up to 0.79-angstrom resolution but more than 90% completeness, leading to unambiguous solution and precise refinement with anisotropic temperature factors. With such a powerful method, the dynamic structures with flexible linkers, degree of interpenetration, position of functional groups, and arrangement of ordered guest molecules are successfully revealed with atomic precision in five 3D COFs, which are almost impossible to be obtained without atomic resolution structure solution. This study demonstrates a practicable strategy for determining the structures of polycrystalline COFs and other beam-sensitive materials and to help in the future discovery of novel materials on the other.",Nature Communications

To this end, covalent organic frameworks (COFs) offer an excellent opportunity for the periodic placement of catalytically active single metal atoms within a porous framework. We report here a synthetic strategy to a series of imide-linked metal-containing phthalocyanine (Pc) COFs with different metal contents. Electrocatalytic activity of the materials towards oxygen evolution reaction was studied under alkaline conditions and the COF prepared from NiPc showed the best performance with current density j = 10 mA cm−2 being reached at overpotential η10 ≈ 410 mV and Tafel slope of b = 75 mV/dec.

Hydrogen plasma treated-Ce-BTC nanorods enable enhanced antibacterial activity and soft tissue sealing ability,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Implant-associated infections caused by the formation of bacterial biofilms on the implant surface are difficult to cure, which will lead to poor integration between soft tissues and percutaneous implants. To solve this issue, in this work, cerium-based metal-organic framework (Ce-BTC) coatings with abundant coordinative unsaturated metal sites were fabricated on medical titanium surfaces by solvothermal treatment and followed by hydrogen plasma immersion ion implantation (H-PIII) treatment. The surface microstructure of Ce-BTC had no obvious changes after H-PIII treatment, while the crystallinity reduced and the organic ligands were partially etched, resulting in more metal active sites being exposed. Consequently, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) deprivation capacity and oxidase-like activity of Ce-BTC were significantly improved by H-PIII treatment, which could effectively prevent biofilm formation and kill bacteria in response to the bacteria-mediated acidic microenvironment. Moreover, the Ce-BTC treated by H-PIII for 15 min could promote the fibroblast responses including cell proliferation and collagen deposition by up-regulating fibroblast-related genes in vitro, which may be ascribed to the surface nanorod structures and the released Ce ions. The percutaneous infection model in vivo further confirmed that the Ce-BTC treated by H-PIII for 15 min had good antibacterial activity and soft tissue sealing ability, which was conducive to the integration between percutaneous implants and surrounding soft tissues.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Subnanometric Ru clusters with upshifted D band center improve performance for alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction,"© 2022, The Author(s).Subnanometric metal clusters usually have unique electronic structures and may display electrocatalytic performance distinctive from single atoms (SAs) and larger nanoparticles (NPs). However, the electrocatalytic performance of clusters, especially the size-activity relationship at the sub-nanoscale, is largely unexplored. Here, we synthesize a series of Ru nanocrystals from single atoms, subnanometric clusters to larger nanoparticles, aiming at investigating the size-dependent activity of hydrogen evolution in alkaline media. It is found that the d band center of Ru downshifts in a nearly linear relationship with the increase of diameter, and the subnanometric Ru clusters with d band center closer to Femi level display a stronger water dissociation ability and thus superior hydrogen evolution activity than SAs and larger nanoparticles. Benefiting from the high metal utilization and strong water dissociation ability, the Ru clusters manifest an ultrahigh turnover frequency of 43.3 s−1 at the overpotential of 100 mV, 36.1-fold larger than the commercial Pt/C.",Nature Communications
Electrochemical-induced surface reconstruction to NiFe-LDHs-based heterostructure as novel positive electrode for supercapacitors with enhanced performance in neutral electrolyte,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Layered double hydroxides (LDHs) are promising battery-type electrode materials for hybrid supercapacitors. However, their poor capacity in neutral electrolyte is the primary limitation for the practical application. Herein, we fabricated a kind of novel NiFe-LDHs-based heterostructure as high-performance electrode materials in neutral electrolyte via a high-voltage electrochemical cycling activation (ECA) strategy. During the high-voltage ECA process, NiFe-LDHs surface was in-situ reconstructed into low-crystalline NiOOH phase, and finally evolved to the unique NiFe-LDHs/NiOOH heterostructures. This surface reconstruction process can generate abundant heterogeneous interface so as to increase the active sites for the reversible adsorption and intercalation of cationic ions, accounting for the significantly improved electrochemical performance in neutral electrolyte. When used as the battery-type electrode material in neutral electrolyte (2 M LiNO3 solution), the obtained ECA (1.2 V-50) electrode exhibits an excellent specific capacity (107 mAh g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1), which is increased by 50 times compared to the Initial-NiFe-LDHs (2.1 mAh g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1). By coupling with a MoS2/rGO electrode, the assembled ECA (1.2 V-50)//MoS2/rGO hybrid supercapacitor device depicts a high energy density of 48.1 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 432.9 W kg−1 in neutral electrolyte, which is superior to most of the reported hybrid supercapacitors.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Interstitial boron-doped nanoporous palladium film for electro-reduction of nitrogen to ammonia,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction to ammonia has attracted abundant research interest due to its mild operation condition and sustainable feedstock. The identification of efficient catalysts with high selectivity of nitrogen reduction is the key for the electro-synthesis of ammonia. Herein, interstitial boron-doped nanoporous palladium film is directly formed on Ni foam (nPdB/NF) via micelle-assisted reduction method using borane dimethylamine complex as reducing agents and boron dopant. The binder-free nanoporous structure provides abundant active sites and facilitated mass/charge transfer. Moreover, the introduction of interstitial boron atoms can modify the electronic structure of Pd, which can both improve the nitrogen adsorption and inhibit hydrogen evolution on nPdB/NF. As such, nPdB/NF exhibits high NH3 yield of 29.0 μg h−1 mg−1cat. and Faraday efficiency of 17.9% in 0.1 M Na2SO4, superior to that of nPd/NF (19.7 μg h−1 mg−1cat and 14.7%).

Electron enriched ternary NiMoB electrocatalyst for improved overall water splitting: Better performance as compared to the Pt/C || RuO2 at high current density,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdThe high energy density and zero carbon emission makes the hydrogen energy most suitable for the next-generation alternative to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions and prevent the climate changes. In this work, the ternary nickel-molybdenum-boron (NiMoB) electrocatalyst is systematically studied and the best optimized NiMoB electrode demonstrates better electrochemical water splitting performance over the benchmark electrodes of Pt/C || RuO2 at high current density. Along with the systematic fabrication parameter optimization, the ternary NiMoB electrocatalyst with the multi-sphere morphology demonstrates significantly high active surface area, low impedance, and low reaction energy barriers with the improved crystallinity of electrodes and absorption and desorption of intermediates. The incorporation of boron in the transition metal matrix of Ni-Mo significantly boosts up the water splitting capability by lowering the kinetic barriers with the electron enriched metallic sites and improved stability of electrodes. Specifically, the turnover overpotential of 1.61 V is achieved at 50 mA/cm2 in 1 M KOH with the improved hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) kinetics in a 2-electrode system. More importantly, the NiMoB electrocatalyst demonstrates better performances at high current range above 1250 mA/cm2 in 1 M KOH and 1100 mA/cm2 in seawater (SW) + 1 M KOH. The NiMoB || NiMoB also demonstrates an equivalent water splitting performance in the real SW + 1 M KOH solution. In addition, a very stable chronoamperometry (CA) operation over 12 h at 500 mA/cm2 and 1,000-time repetition of linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) over 8 h in 6 M KOH at 60 °C confirm that the optimized electrode can demonstrate stable and repetitive operations in an industrial electrochemical water splitting condition.",Applied Materials Today
Bimetallic-ZIFs derived quaternary amorphous LDHs decorated with crystalline Ag nanoparticles for highly efficient oxygen evolution reaction,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Amorphous LDHs materials have been considered promising electrocatalysts for OER since their abundant coordination sites but still undergo poor stability. It is an efficient strategy to rationally architect amorphous/crystalline hybrid nanostructures on the ZIFs-derived amorphous LDH counterparts. Herein, we provide a facile two-step method to fabricate crystalline Ag NPs decorated amorphous QLDHs (Ag/QLDHs) nanosheet arrays on the Ni foam through ions exchange and spontaneous redox reaction. Based on the multi-metal synergetic effects (Co, Zn, Fe, Ni) and regulation of Ag nanoparticles (NPs), the as-formed Ag/QLDHs with heterogeneously hierarchal structures exhibit excellent OER performance with a low overpotential of 216 and 247 mV under 10 and 100 mA cm−2 in 1 M KOH, respectively, together with highly structural robustness. Through using the in situ-Raman spectroscopy, we reveal that the Ag NPs play the important role in enhancing the oxidation state of Ni and Fe species in Ag/QLDHs, which facilitates the generation of active MOx(OH)y at a much lower potential. The synthesized approach proposed in this work will supply a promising pathway for constructing amorphous/crystalline hybrid structures applied to alkaline water oxidation.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Constructing double-shell structured N-C-in-Co/N-C electrocatalysts with nanorod- and rhombic dodecahedron-shaped hollow morphologies to boost electrocatalytic activity for hydrogen evolution and triiodide reduction reaction,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.With the increasing energy demands and impending climate change, significant concerns have been raised over the metal–organic frameworks (MOFs)-derived porous carbons and their utilization for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and triiodide reduction reaction (IRR). However, the provision of high intrinsic activity, active-site accessibility, and structural stability of MOF-derived Co-embedded N-doped carbon (Co/N-C) for HER and IRR is challenging. In this work, core-shell MOF-in-MOF precursors are designed to construct novel double-shell N-C-in-Co/N-C electrocatalysts with nanorod- and rhombic dodecahedron-shaped hollow morphologies (NR-H-C and RD-H-C). The double-shell structured NR-H-C and RD-H-C significantly enhance the HER and IRR activity of Co-MOF-derived Co/N-C. Specifically, NR-H-C achieves a high N-content (10.35 at.%), large specific surface area (590.87 m2 g−1), and hierarchical porous configuration (micropores and mesopores). When NR-H-C is applied as the HER catalyst in alkaline electrolyte, it exhibits an admired overpotential of 123 mV at 10 mA cm−2 and a Tafel slope of 51 mV dec−1. The solar cell adopting NR-H-C as counter electrode for IRR achieves a high short circuit current density of 16.77 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage of 0.745 V, a fill factor of 0.682, and a power conversion efficiency of 8.51%, higher than that of Pt-based solar cell (16.26 mA cm−2, 0.744 V, 0.602, and 7.28%). The elucidatory Volmer-Heyrovsky HER mechanism and reversed Volmer-Heyrovsky IRR mechanism give a better understanding of the enhanced dual-functional activity of NR-H-C. This work provides an essential information for the rational design of high-performance dual-functional HER and IRR catalysts and further open up a new avenue for the construction of multicomponent MOFs in the energy conversion field.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Electronic structure modulation of molybdenum-iron double-atom catalyst for bifunctional oxygen electrochemistry,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Exploration of cost effective and high performance electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is becoming the paramount interest towards the emerging renewable energy technologies such as fuel cells, metal air-batteries and water electrolysers, etc. One of such catalysts is single atom catalyst that exhibits well defined active sites with very high atom utilization efficiency but selective mainly towards ORR. We demonstrate one-step synthesis of carbon–nitrogen (CN)-coordinated Fe-Mo double atom catalyst with high atom utilization efficiency towards both ORR and OER. The catalyst exhibits enhanced activity with lower overpotential associated with ORR and OER (ΔE = Ej=10(OER) - E1/2(ORR)) and better mass activity in comparison to that of Mo-N-C and Fe-N-C, even better than the state-of-the-art Pt/C and RuO2 catalysts for ORR and OER, respectively. This place the double atom catalysts in the series of non-precious metal based bifunctional catalysts for overall oxygen electrochemistry and is due to the electronic structure modification around the metal atoms induced by other neighbouring metal atom. The double atom Fe-Mo-N-C exhibits a remarkable and highly durable ORR performance with suppressed peroxide generation due to the muted outer sphere electron transfer mechanism in comparison with the commercially available state-of-the-art Pt/C electrocatalyst. Moreover, Fe-Mo-N-C shows remarkable enhanced overall oxygen electrochemistry at higher temperature (323 K - a temperature 25 K above the room temperature), widening its applicability. Overall, this work paves the way to design multi-atom catalysts towards multi-functional electrocatalytic activities.",Chemical Engineering Journal

Bixbyite-type Ln2O3 as promoters of metallic Ni for alkaline electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution,"© 2022, The Author(s).The active-site density, intrinsic activity, and durability of Ni-based catalysts are critical to their application in industrial alkaline water electrolysis. This work develops a kind of promoters, the bixbyite-type lanthanide metal sesquioxides (Ln2O3), which can be implanted into metallic Ni by selective high-temperature reduction to achieve highly efficient Ni/Ln2O3 hybrid electrocatalysts toward hydrogen evolution reaction. The screened Ni/Yb2O3 catalyst shows the low overpotential (20.0 mV at 10 mA cm−2), low Tafel slope (44.6 mV dec−1), and excellent long-term durability (360 h at 500 mA cm−2), significantly outperforming the metallic Ni and benchmark Pt/C catalysts. The remarkable hydrogen evolution activity and stability of Ni/Yb2O3 are attributed to that the Yb2O3 promoter with high oxophilicity and thermodynamic stability can greatly enlarge the active-site density, reduce the energy barrier of water dissociation, optimize the free energy of hydrogen adsorption, and avoid the oxidation corrosion of Ni.",Nature Communications
Dynamic covalent chemistry concept toward preparing crystalline covalent organic frameworks for dual-mode acidochromic responses,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdCovalent organic frameworks (COFs), as an emerging class of porous materials, have recently received increasing interest because of their diverse and designable structure. Developing structural stable COFs is still a long-term goal for practical application. Herein, a chemical agent-induced dynamic covalent chemistry (DCC) regrowth strategy was proposed to synthesize urchin-like imine-linked COF with high crystallinity and chemical stability, evidenced by X-ray diffraction spectroscopy, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, selected area electron diffraction, and thermal gravimetric analyzer. Additionally, the reversible protonation of the imine nitrogen in the framework endowed the COF with excellent water dispersibility, which can readily form a stable solution system. The corresponded changes of the conjugated π electronic structure led to characteristic colorimetric and fluorescent acidochromic responses over a wide pH range without COF decomposition. The drastically increased structural stability provides useful insights into the design and synthesis of functional COFs for practical application.",Materials Today Chemistry
In situ fragmented and confined CoP nanocrystals into sandwich-structure MXene@CoP@NPC heterostructure for superior sodium-ion storage,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdThe investigation of suitable anode materials for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) is highly appealing in order to tackle the obstacles of large electrode volume variation and sluggish charge kinetic caused by the larger radius of Na+ than that of Li+. Recently, cobalt phosphides (CoP) have attracted extensive attention for anode materials because of their relatively high theoretical capacity and electric conductivity. In light of that, we propose a new fabrication approach for the synthesis of layered zeolitic imidazolate framework-67 (ZIF-L)-derived CoP nanoparticles encapsulated into N, P co-doped carbon layers and conductive MXene substrate to form sandwich-structure MXene@CoP@NPC hybrids. Specifically, the MXene and wafer-like ZIF-L hybrids are used as precursor, which is treated with subsequent carbonation with low temperature (435 °C) for a long time of 8 h, and then coupled with phosphidation reaction. The MXene substrate not only provides abundant growing sites for ZIF-L, for avoiding aggregation of CoP nanoparticles, but also enhances the electric conductivity of sandwich-structure hybrid. Furthermore, the in situ formed carbon layer can effectively ensure stable structural integrity by buffering volume expansion and improving overall conductivity. Concurrently, CoP nanocrystals, outer carbon layer, and MXene substrate form stable interface by strong chemical interaction, inducing promoted surface charge transfer kinetic. Consequently, the MXene@CoP@NPC anode exhibits outstanding rate capability with a highly reversible capacity of 198 mAh/g at 5.0 A/g and long-time cycling performance with 155 mAh/g at 1.0 A/g after 1000 cycles (0.023% capacity loss per cycle).",Materials Today Chemistry
Thermoresponsive MXene nanocomposite catalyst with high activity and thermosensitivity for controlled heterogeneous catalysis,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdHigh-performance catalytic reactions and easy-to-recycle property of noble metal catalysts are desirable in chemical productions, and a suitably combined pathway of both homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis is promising in this regard. Herein, a novel thermoresponsive nanocomposite catalyst is designed through the “grafting-from” reaction of the thermoresponsive motifs and the “self-reduction” reaction of the noble metal ions at transition metal carbides (MXene) surface. The prepared catalyst with Au nanoparticles as active catalytic species, poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) as thermoresponsive switch, and MXene as catalyst-carrying substrate has a superior thermoresponsiveness of phase transitions (i.e., between suspended and aggregated states in aqueous conditions), which facilitates to the control of heterogeneous catalysis by surrounding temperatures. A high turnover frequency of up to 11.73 min−1 can be achieved for the 4-nitrophenol reduction at room temperature. Notably, the reaction can be easily terminated at elevated temperatures (e.g., 40 °C), with the catalysts being separated and recovered (i.e., by precipitation) in the meantime. The nanocomposite therefore combines both merits of the homogeneous catalysts (e.g., high-performance) and the heterogeneous catalysts (i.e., easy-to-recycle) and display tunable catalytic activity at low/high temperatures. The design principle and the smart ON/OFF control of the catalytic process demonstrated in this work are promising for industrial applications.",Materials Today Chemistry
Anti-dissolution Pt single site with Pt(OH)(O3)/Co(P) coordination for efficient alkaline water splitting electrolyzer,"© 2022, The Author(s).As the most well-known electrocatalyst for cathodic hydrogen evolution in water splitting electrolyzers, platinum is unfortunately inefficient for anodic oxygen evolution due to its over-binding with oxygen species and excessive dissolution in oxidative environment. Herein we show that single Pt atoms dispersed in cobalt hydrogen phosphate with an unique Pt(OH)(O3)/Co(P) coordination can achieve remarkable catalytic activity and stability for oxygen evolution. The catalyst yields a high turnover frequency (35.1 ± 5.2 s−1) and mass activity (69.5 ± 10.3 A mg−1) at an overpotential of 300 mV and excellent stability. Mechanistic studies elucidate that the superior catalytic performance of isolated Pt atoms herein stems from optimal binding energies of oxygen intermediate and also their strong electronic coupling with neighboring Co atoms that suppresses the formation of soluble Ptx>4 species. Alkaline water electrolyzers assembled with an ultralow Pt loading realizes an industrial-level current density of 1 A cm−2 at 1.8 volts with a high durability.",Nature Communications
Surface modulation of MoS2/O-ZnIn2S4 to boost photocatalytic H2 evolution,"© 2022 Science Press and Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of SciencesTo realize the continuous production of hydrogen energy, the efficient photocatalysts are required in the heterogeneous reaction for water splitting. Herein, we reported a surface modulation strategy, via doping oxygen atoms to tune the surface state of ZnIn2S4 nanosheets with cocatalyst MoS2 modification, to enhance water adsorption and surface catalytic reaction for boosting the photocatalytic activity. Consequently, MoS2/O-ZnIn2S4 photocatalysts showed a remarkably superior photocatalytic H2 production performance of 4.002 mmol g−1 h−1 and an apparent quantum yield (AQY) of ∼2.53%, 5.4 folds higher than ZnIn2S4. Using operando infrared spectroscopy and DFT calculation, we revealed the dynamic structural evolution, as well as the active sites for water adsorption and the catalytic reaction at the MoS2/O-ZnIn2S4 interface. This work reveals the effect of surface modulation on the photocatalytic activity for MoS2/O-ZnIn2S4 and offers a feasible method to devise excellent nanomaterial photocatalysts for H2 production.",Journal of Energy Chemistry
Single-atom Pt catalysts as oxidase mimic for p-benzoquinone and α-glucosidase activity detection,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Highly-efficient nanozymes and suitable substrates are the two most important breakthroughs for the construction of novel nanozyme-based enzyme activity assays with good analytical performance. In this work, we demonstrated that the single-atom Pt catalysts could exhibit superior oxidase-mimetic activity due to the fully exposure and utilization of every Pt-involved active sites. This oxidase mimic efficaciously boosts the generation of H2O2 and 1O2 species, and ultimately the chromogenic reaction of 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB). Fascinatingly, hydroquinone (HQ) inhibits the above reaction more sensitively than other phenolics, based on which, colorimetric HQ detection can be rationally achieved. Further, a colorimetric assay for α-glucosidase (α-Glu) detection is innovatively designed by using a robust HQ-generating phenolic, α-Arbutin, as the substrate. The wide linear range (0.01–8 U/mL) and low detection limit (0.0038 U/mL) indicate an admirable analytical performance that surpasses the vast majority of α-Glu assays previously reported. Encouragingly, the proposed colorimetric sensor has been successfully used for the detection of α-Glu in serum samples and the construction of “NAND” logic gate. This study not only provides ideas for the preparation of novel single-atom catalysts with enhanced oxidase-like activity, but also broadens the prospect for the design of new optical α-Glu assays by exploring suitable substrates.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Facet-Selective hydrogen evolution on Rh2P electrocatalysts in pH-Universal media,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Surface atomic structures of transition metal phosphides determine the electrocatalytic activities toward hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). In this work, we developed a new facet-guided phosphorization strategy to synthesize Rh2P electrocatalysts with tunable facet exposure and further unveil their intrinsic facet-dependent HER activity in pH-universal media. The Rh2P nanoparticles feature {1 1 1} and {2 0 0} facets when the precursors of Rh nanoctahedron and nanocube are used, respectively. The Rh2P{2 0 0} catalyst showed a remarkable HER performance with the overpotential of 23, 22 and 54 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm−2 in 1.0 M KOH, 0.5 M H2SO4 and 1.0 M phosphate buffer, respectively. The mass activity and specific activity of Rh2P{2 0 0} were 3～5-times higher than those of Rh2P{1 1 1} and Pt/C catalysts. As elucidated using theoretical calculations, the overlapping of Rh-4d and P-3p of Rh2P{2 0 0} and Rh2P{1 1 1} results in distinct electronic states of surface Rh atoms, leading to varied free energies for water dissociation and hydrogen adsorption/desorption.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Transition metal phosphides for heterogeneous Fenton-like oxidation of contaminants in water,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.The development of low cost, efficient materials for heterogeneous Fenton-like catalysis continues to be an active area of research for water treatment. Over the past few years, transition metal phosphides (MPs) have witnessed rapid development and their application fields are rapidly expanding from photocatalytic water splitting to advanced oxidation. The unique metalloid structure and superior electron conductivity of these materials endow them with significantly raised catalytic activity for interfacial reactions relative to their corresponding oxyhydroxides, although the existing studies are still at laboratory scale and the insufficient mechanical study and material engineering are still key barriers to practical application. In this review, we summarize the progress in MPs-based heterogenous Fenton-like processes by introducing the fundamentals and catalytic performances of various MPs for activation of hydrogen peroxide, persulfate or dioxygen, both under normal and electro-assisted or photo-assisted scenarios. In addition, we discuss the remaining challenges for their practical water treatment application and offer perspectives on possible future research directions.",Chemical Engineering Journal
RuO2 electronic structure and lattice strain dual engineering for enhanced acidic oxygen evolution reaction performance,"© 2022, The Author(s).Developing highly active and durable electrocatalysts for acidic oxygen evolution reaction remains a great challenge due to the sluggish kinetics of the four-electron transfer reaction and severe catalyst dissolution. Here we report an electrochemical lithium intercalation method to improve both the activity and stability of RuO2 for acidic oxygen evolution reaction. The lithium intercalates into the lattice interstices of RuO2, donates electrons and distorts the local structure. Therefore, the Ru valence state is lowered with formation of stable Li-O-Ru local structure, and the Ru–O covalency is weakened, which suppresses the dissolution of Ru, resulting in greatly enhanced durability. Meanwhile, the inherent lattice strain results in the surface structural distortion of LixRuO2 and activates the dangling O atom near the Ru active site as a proton acceptor, which stabilizes the OOH* and dramatically enhances the activity. This work provides an effective strategy to develop highly efficient catalyst towards water splitting.",Nature Communications
Unraveling the role of tungsten as a minor alloying element in the oxidation NiCr alloys,"© 2022, The Author(s).Ni-based superalloys offer a unique combination of mechanical properties, corrosion resistance and high temperature performance. Near ambient pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy was used to study in operando the initial steps of oxidation for Ni-5Cr, Ni-15Cr, Ni-30Cr and Ni-15Cr-6W at 500 °C, p(O2)=10−6 mbar. The comparison of oxide evolution for these alloys quantifies the outsized impact of W in promoting chromia formation. For the binary alloys an increase in chromia due to Cr-surface enrichment is followed by NiO nucleation and growth thus seeding a dual-layer structure. The addition of W (Ni-15Cr-6W) shifts the reaction pathways towards chromia thus enhancing oxide quality. Density functional theory calculations confirm that W atoms adjacent to Cr create highly favorable oxygen adsorption sites. The addition of W supercharges the reactivity of Cr with oxygen essentially funneling oxygen atoms into Cr sites. The experimental results are discussed in the context of surface composition, chemistry, reactant fluxes, and microstructure.",npj Materials Degradation
Conductive tungsten oxynitride supported highly dispersed cobalt nanoclusters for enhanced oxygen reduction,"© 2022Herein, a high-performance electrocatalyst for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), which is composed of highly dispersed Co nanoclusters loaded on conductive oxygen-deficient tungsten oxynitride framework structured with three-dimensionally ordered macropores (3DOM Co@WNO) was proposed. The tungsten oxynitride carrier decorated with oxygen vacancies can improve the conductivity and electrochemical stability of the catalyst. At the same time, it offers strong anchoring interaction and ensures good dispersion for the loaded Co metals, thus achieving high catalytic activity and durability. Theoretical calculations show that electron transfer occurs at the interface between WNO and Co4 leading to a higher accumulation of electrons around the Co site, promoting the ORR reaction kinetics. Due to these advantages, 3DOM Co@WNO was found to possess ORR activity comparable to Pt/C and superior primary Zn-air battery performance over Pt/C and excellent stability as well. This study advances the evolvement of high-efficiency and durable ORR electrocatalysts using intrinsically robust and conductive oxynitride support strategy with strong metal-support interactions.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Quasi-solid-state Zn-air batteries with an atomically dispersed cobalt electrocatalyst and organohydrogel electrolyte,"© 2022, The Author(s).Quasi-solid-state Zn-air batteries are usually limited to relatively low-rate ability (<10 mA cm−2), which is caused in part by sluggish oxygen electrocatalysis and unstable electrochemical interfaces. Here we present a high-rate and robust quasi-solid-state Zn-air battery enabled by atomically dispersed cobalt sites anchored on wrinkled nitrogen doped graphene as the air cathode and a polyacrylamide organohydrogel electrolyte with its hydrogen-bond network modified by the addition of dimethyl sulfoxide. This design enables a cycling current density of 100 mA cm−2 over 50 h at 25 °C. A low-temperature cycling stability of over 300 h (at 0.5 mA cm−2) with over 90% capacity retention at −60 °C and a broad temperature adaptability (−60 to 60 °C) are also demonstrated.",Nature Communications
Activation of nitrogen species mixed with Ar and H2S plasma for directly N-doped TMD films synthesis,"© 2022, The Author(s).Among the transition metal dichalcogenides (TMD), tungsten disulfide (WS2) and molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) are promising sulfides for replacing noble metals in the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) owing to their abundance and good catalytic activity. However, the catalytic activity is derived from the edge sites of WS2 and MoS2, while their basal planes are inert. We propose a novel process for N-doped TMD synthesis for advanced HER using N2 + Ar + H2S plasma. The high ionization energy of Ar gas enabled nitrogen species activation results in efficient N-doping of TMD (named In situ-MoS2 and In situ-WS2). In situ-MoS2 and WS2 were characterized by various techniques (Raman spectroscopy, XPS, HR-TEM, TOF–SIMS, and OES), confirming nanocrystalline and N-doping. The N-doped TMD were used as electrocatalysts for the HER, with overpotentials of 294 mV (In situ-MoS2) and 298 mV (In situ-WS2) at a current density of 10 mA cm−2, which are lower than those of pristine MoS2 and WS2, respectively. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were conducted for the hydrogen Gibbs energy (∆GH) to investigate the effect of N doping on the HER activity. Mixed gas plasma proposes a facile and novel fabrication process for direct N doping on TMD as a suitable HER electrocatalyst.",Scientific Reports
The physical and optical investigations of the tannic acid functionalised Cu-based oxide nanostructures,"© 2022, The Author(s).The need for a mild, low-cost, green environment that is able to produce exotic properties of output nanostructures is appealing nowadays. Employing these requirements, the copper (Cu)—based oxide nanostructures have been successfully synthesised via one-pot reaction using biocompatible natural polyphenol, tannic acid (TA) as both the reducing agent and stabiliser at 60, 70 and 80 °C. The structural and optical studies disclosed the effect of TA on the surface morphology, phase purity, elemental composition, optical microstrain and optical intrinsic energy of this mixed Cu2O and CuO nanostructures. The optically based method describes the comparative details of the multi-band gap in the presence of more than one element with overlapping spectra from the first-derivative absorbance curve ΔEΔA and the exponential absorbance of Urbach tail energy EU towards the conventional Tauc bandgap. The ΔEΔA demonstrates that the pronounced effect of TA that Cu2O and CuO nanostructures creates much sensitive first-derivative bandgap output compared to the Tauc bandgap. The results also show that the EU reduced as the temperature reaches 70 °C and then experienced sudden increase at 80 °C. The change in the pattern is parallel to the trend observed in the Williamson–Hall microstrain and is evident from the variations of the mean crystallite size Dm which is also a cause response to the change in temperature or pH. Therefore, the current work has elucidated that the structural and optical correlations on the as-synthesised Cu2O and CuO nanostructures in the presence of TA were the combined reaction of pH change and the ligand complexation reactions. The acquired results suggest a more comprehensive range of studies to further understand the extent relationship between the physical and optical properties of TA functionalised Cu-based oxide nanostructures.",Scientific Reports
Enhancement of electrocatalytic oxygen evolution by chiral molecular functionalization of hybrid 2D electrodes,"© 2022, The Author(s).A sustainable future requires highly efficient energy conversion and storage processes, where electrocatalysis plays a crucial role. The activity of an electrocatalyst is governed by the binding energy towards the reaction intermediates, while the scaling relationships prevent the improvement of a catalytic system over its volcano-plot limits. To overcome these limitations, unconventional methods that are not fully determined by the surface binding energy can be helpful. Here, we use organic chiral molecules, i.e., hetero-helicenes such as thiadiazole-[7]helicene and bis(thiadiazole)-[8]helicene, to boost the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) by up to ca. 130 % (at the potential of 1.65 V vs. RHE) at state-of-the-art 2D Ni- and NiFe-based catalysts via a spin-polarization mechanism. Our results show that chiral molecule-functionalization is able to increase the OER activity of catalysts beyond the volcano limits. A guideline for optimizing the catalytic activity via chiral molecular functionalization of hybrid 2D electrodes is given.",Nature Communications
Defect engineering of layered double hydroxide nanosheets as inorganic photosensitizers for NIR-III photodynamic cancer therapy,"© 2022, The Author(s).Although two-dimensional (2D) layered double hydroxides (LDHs) have been widely used as efficient nanoagents for biological diagnosis and treatment, they have been found to be inert as photosensitizers (PSs) for photodynamic therapy (PDT). Herein, we report the defect engineering of ultrathin 2D CoMo-LDH and NiMo-LDH nanosheets as highly active inorganic PSs for PDT in the third near-infrared (NIR-III) window. Hydrothermal-synthesized 2D CoMo-LDH and NiMo-LDH nanosheets are etched via a simple acid treatment to obtain defect-rich CoMo-LDH and NiMo-LDH nanosheets. Importantly, the defect-rich CoMo-LDH nanosheets exhibit much higher activity (~97 times) for generation of reactive oxygen species than that of the pristine CoMo-LDH nanosheets under a NIR-III 1567 nm laser irradiation. Therefore, after modification with polyethylene glycol, the defect-rich CoMo-LDH nanosheets can be used as an efficient inorganic PS for PDT to efficiently induce cancer cells apoptosis in vitro and eradicate tumors in vivo under 1567 nm laser irradiation.",Nature Communications
Ultrafast self-heating synthesis of robust heterogeneous nanocarbides for high current density hydrogen evolution reaction,"© 2022, The Author(s).Designing cost-effective and high-efficiency catalysts to electrolyze water is an effective way of producing hydrogen. Practical applications require highly active and stable hydrogen evolution reaction catalysts working at high current densities (≥1000 mA cm−2). However, it is challenging to simultaneously enhance the catalytic activity and interface stability of these catalysts. Herein, we report a rapid, energy-saving, and self-heating method to synthesize high-efficiency Mo2C/MoC/carbon nanotube hydrogen evolution reaction catalysts by ultrafast heating and cooling. The experiments and density functional theory calculations reveal that numerous Mo2C/MoC hetero-interfaces offer abundant active sites with a moderate hydrogen adsorption free energy ΔGH* (0.02 eV), and strong chemical bonding between the Mo2C/MoC catalysts and carbon nanotube heater/electrode significantly enhances the mechanical stability owing to instantaneous high temperature. As a result, the Mo2C/MoC/carbon nanotube catalyst achieves low overpotentials of 233 and 255 mV at 1000 and 1500 mA cm−2 in 1 M KOH, respectively, and the overpotential shows only a slight change after working at 1000 mA cm−2 for 14 days, suggesting the excellent activity and stability of the high-current-density hydrogen evolution reaction catalyst. The promising activity, excellent stability, and high productivity of our catalyst can fulfil the demands of hydrogen production in various applications.",Nature Communications
Hierarchically porous carbon derived from natural Porphyra for excellent electromagnetic wave absorption,"© 2022A highly efficient absorber with features including lightweight, broad bandwidth, and tunable electromagnetic property still remains challenging for practical applications. Herein, the Porphyra-derived porous carbon (PPC) was fabricated via facile procedures of low-temperature pre-carbonization combined with KOH chemical activation. The composition, microstructure, and electromagnetic wave absorption properties of the samples were elucidated based on X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Brunauer−Emmer−Teller (BET), and vector network analyzer (VNA). The porosity of PPC can be readily regulated by adjusting activation temperature. The PPC obtained at 750 °C was composed of a three-dimensional hierarchically porous carbon network. The C and N elements of natural Porphyra were introduced into the carbon skeleton during the carbonization process. The large specific surface, dopants, and three-dimensional hierarchically porous carbon network can effectively improve the impedance matching and dielectric dissipation, leading to an excellent electromagnetic wave absorption performance. Especially, the optimal reflection loss (RL) value reached –57.75 dB at 9.68 GHz with a broad bandwidth (RL < –10 dB) value of 7.60 GHz at 3.5 mm. Overall, the results indicate that the PPC can provide a new way to achieve lightweight, effective, and sustainable absorbers.",Journal of Materials Science and Technology
Unraveling the mechanism for paired electrocatalysis of organics with water as a feedstock,"© 2022, The Author(s).Paired electroreduction and electrooxidation of organics with water as a feedstock to produce value-added chemicals is meaningful. A comprehensive understanding of reaction mechanism is critical for the catalyst design and relative area development. Here, we have systematically studied the mechanism of the paired electroreduction and electrooxidation of organics on Fe-Mo-based phosphide heterojunctions. It is shown that active H* species for organic electroreduction originate from water. As for organic electrooxidation, among various oxygen species (OH*, OOH*, and O*), OH* free radicals derived from the first step of water dissociation are identified as active species. Furthermore, explicit reaction pathways and their paired advantages are proposed based on theoretical calculations. The paired electrolyzer powered by a solar cell shows a low voltage of 1.594 V at 100 mA cm−2, faradaic efficiency of ≥99%, and remarkable cycle stability. This work provides a guide for sustainable synthesis of various value-added chemicals via paired electrocatalysis.",Nature Communications
Boosting the performance of single-atom catalysts via external electric field polarization,"© 2022, The Author(s).Single-atom catalysts represent a unique catalytic system with high atomic utilization and tunable reaction pathway. Despite current successes in their optimization and tailoring through structural and synthetic innovations, there is a lack of dynamic modulation approach for the single-atom catalysis. Inspired by the electrostatic interaction within specific natural enzymes, here we show the performance of model single-atom catalysts anchored on two-dimensional atomic crystals can be systematically and efficiently tuned by oriented external electric fields. Superior electrocatalytic performance have been achieved in single-atom catalysts under electrostatic modulations. Theoretical investigations suggest a universal “onsite electrostatic polarization” mechanism, in which electrostatic fields significantly polarize charge distributions at the single-atom sites and alter the kinetics of the rate determining steps, leading to boosted reaction performances. Such field-induced on-site polarization offers a unique strategy for simulating the catalytic processes in natural enzyme systems with quantitative, precise and dynamic external electric fields.",Nature Communications
Highly active and thermostable submonolayer La(NiCo)OΔ catalyst stabilized by a perovskite LaCrO3 support,"© 2022, The Author(s).It is important to develop highly active and stable catalysts for high temperature reactions, such as dry reforming of methane. Here we show a La(NiCo)OΔ (LNCO) submonolayer catalyst (SMLC) stabilized by the surface lattice of a perovskite LaCrO3 support and demonstrate a Ni-Co synergistic effect. The submonolayer/support type catalyst was prepared by in-situ hydrogen reduction of a LaNi0.05Co0.05Cr0.9O3 precursor synthesized by a sol-gel method. The LNCO-SMLC is highly active and very stable during a 100 h on stream test at 750 °C under the reaction conditions of dry reforming of methane. The catalyst also shows good anti-coking ability. We found that the synergistic effect between Ni and Co atoms in LNCO-SMLC remarkably improved the thermostability of the catalyst. This work provides a useful concept for designing atomically dispersed catalysts with high thermostability.",Communications Chemistry
Halogen-doped phosphorescent carbon dots for grayscale patterning,"© 2022, The Author(s).Flexible organic materials that exhibit dynamic ultralong room temperature phosphorescence (DURTP) via photoactivation have attracted increasing research interest for their fascinating functions of reversibly writing-reading-erasing graphic information in the form of a long afterglow. However, due to the existence of a nonnegligible activation threshold for the initial exposure dose, the display mode of these materials has thus far been limited to binary patterns. By resorting to halogen element doping of carbon dots (CDs) to enhance intersystem crossing and reduce the activation threshold, we were able to produce, for the first time, a transparent, flexible, and fully programmable DURTP composite film with a reliable grayscale display capacity. Examples of promising applications in UV photography and highly confidential steganography were constructed, partially demonstrating the broad future applications of this material as a programmable platform with a high optical information density.",Light: Science and Applications
Imaging the facet surface strain state of supported multi-faceted Pt nanoparticles during reaction,"© 2022, The Author(s).Nanostructures with specific crystallographic planes display distinctive physico-chemical properties because of their unique atomic arrangements, resulting in widespread applications in catalysis, energy conversion or sensing. Understanding strain dynamics and their relationship with crystallographic facets have been largely unexplored. Here, we reveal in situ, in three-dimensions and at the nanoscale, the volume, surface and interface strain evolution of single supported platinum nanocrystals during reaction using coherent x-ray diffractive imaging. Interestingly, identical {hkl} facets show equivalent catalytic response during non-stoichiometric cycles. Periodic strain variations are rationalised in terms of O2 adsorption or desorption during O2 exposure or CO oxidation under reducing conditions, respectively. During stoichiometric CO oxidation, the strain evolution is, however, no longer facet dependent. Large strain variations are observed in localised areas, in particular in the vicinity of the substrate/particle interface, suggesting a significant influence of the substrate on the reactivity. These findings will improve the understanding of dynamic properties in catalysis and related fields.",Nature Communications
Iron atom–cluster interactions increase activity and improve durability in Fe–N–C fuel cells,"© 2022, The Author(s).Simultaneously increasing the activity and stability of the single-atom active sites of M–N–C catalysts is critical but remains a great challenge. Here, we report an Fe–N–C catalyst with nitrogen-coordinated iron clusters and closely surrounding Fe–N4 active sites for oxygen reduction reaction in acidic fuel cells. A strong electronic interaction is built between iron clusters and satellite Fe–N4 due to unblocked electron transfer pathways and very short interacting distances. The iron clusters optimize the adsorption strength of oxygen reduction intermediates on Fe–N4 and also shorten the bond amplitude of Fe–N4 with incoherent vibrations. As a result, both the activity and stability of Fe–N4 sites are increased by about 60% in terms of turnover frequency and demetalation resistance. This work shows the great potential of strong electronic interactions between multiphase metal species for improvements of single-atom catalysts.",Nature Communications
Electrochemical oxygen reduction to hydrogen peroxide at practical rates in strong acidic media,"© 2022, The Author(s).Electrochemical oxygen reduction to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in acidic media, especially in proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrode assembly reactors, suffers from low selectivity and the lack of low-cost catalysts. Here we present a cation-regulated interfacial engineering approach to promote the H2O2 selectivity (over 80%) under industrial-relevant generation rates (over 400 mA cm−2) in strong acidic media using just carbon black catalyst and a small number of alkali metal cations, representing a 25-fold improvement compared to that without cation additives. Our density functional theory simulation suggests a “shielding effect” of alkali metal cations which squeeze away the catalyst/electrolyte interfacial protons and thus prevent further reduction of generated H2O2 to water. A double-PEM solid electrolyte reactor was further developed to realize a continuous, selective (∼90%) and stable (over 500 hours) generation of H2O2 via implementing this cation effect for practical applications.",Nature Communications
Hollow mesoporous atomically dispersed metal-nitrogen-carbon catalysts with enhanced diffusion for catalysis involving larger molecules,"© 2022, The Author(s).Single-atom catalysts (SACs) show great promise in various applications due to their maximal atom utilization efficiency. However, the controlled synthesis of SACs with appropriate porous structures remains a challenge that must be overcome to address the diffusion issues in catalysis. Resolving these diffusion issues has become increasingly important because the intrinsic activity of the catalysts is dramatically improved by spatially isolated single-atom sites. Herein, we develop a facile topo-conversion strategy for fabricating hollow mesoporous metal-nitrogen-carbon SACs with enhanced diffusion for catalysis. Several hollow mesoporous metal-nitrogen-carbon SACs, including Co, Ni, Mn and Cu, are successfully fabricated by this strategy. Taking hollow mesoporous cobalt-nitrogen-carbon SACs as a proof-of-concept, diffusion and kinetic experiments demonstrate the enhanced diffusion of hollow mesoporous structures compared to the solid ones, which alleviates the bottleneck of poor mass transport in catalysis, especially involving larger molecules. Impressively, the combination of superior intrinsic activity from Co-N4 sites and the enhanced diffusion from the hollow mesoporous nanoarchitecture significantly improves the catalytic performance of the oxidative coupling of aniline and its derivatives.",Nature Communications
Coordination environment tuning of nickel sites by oxyanions to optimize methanol electro-oxidation activity,"© 2022, The Author(s).To achieve zero-carbon economy, advanced anode catalysts are desirable for hydrogen production and biomass upgrading powered by renewable energy. Ni-based non-precious electrocatalysts are considered as potential candidates because of intrinsic redox attributes, but in-depth understanding and rational design of Ni site coordination still remain challenging. Here, we perform anodic electrochemical oxidation of Ni-metalloids (NiPx, NiSx, and NiSex) to in-situ construct different oxyanion-coordinated amorphous nickel oxyhydroxides (NiOOH-TOx), among which NiOOH-POx shows optimal local coordination environment and boosts electrocatalytic activity of Ni sites towards selective oxidation of methanol to formate. Experiments and theoretical results demonstrate that NiOOH-POx possesses improved adsorption of OH* and methanol, and favors the formation of CH3O* intermediates. The coordinated phosphate oxyanions effectively tailor the d band center of Ni sites and increases Ni-O covalency, promoting the catalytic activity. This study provides additional insights into modulation of active-center coordination environment via oxyanions for organic molecules transformation.",Nature Communications
Dynamic hetero-metallic bondings visualized by sequential atom imaging,"© 2022, The Author(s).Traditionally, chemistry has been developed to obtain thermodynamically stable and isolable compounds such as molecules and solids by chemical reactions. However, recent developments in computational chemistry have placed increased importance on studying the dynamic assembly and disassembly of atoms and molecules formed in situ. This study directly visualizes the formation and dissociation dynamics of labile dimers and trimers at atomic resolution with elemental identification. The video recordings of many homo- and hetero-metallic dimers are carried out by combining scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) with elemental identification based on the Z-contrast principle. Even short-lived molecules with low probability of existence such as AuAg, AgCu, and AuAgCu are directly visualized as a result of identifying moving atoms at low electron doses.",Nature Communications
Synergy of Pd atoms and oxygen vacancies on In2O3 for methane conversion under visible light,"© 2022, The Author(s).Methane (CH4) oxidation to high value chemicals under mild conditions through photocatalysis is a sustainable and appealing pathway, nevertheless confronting the critical issues regarding both conversion and selectivity. Herein, under visible irradiation (420 nm), the synergy of palladium (Pd) atom cocatalyst and oxygen vacancies (OVs) on In2O3 nanorods enables superior photocatalytic CH4 activation by O2. The optimized catalyst reaches ca. 100 μmol h−1 of C1 oxygenates, with a selectivity of primary products (CH3OH and CH3OOH) up to 82.5%. Mechanism investigation elucidates that such superior photocatalysis is induced by the dedicated function of Pd single atoms and oxygen vacancies on boosting hole and electron transfer, respectively. O2 is proven to be the only oxygen source for CH3OH production, while H2O acts as the promoter for efficient CH4 activation through ·OH production and facilitates product desorption as indicated by DFT modeling. This work thus provides new understandings on simultaneous regulation of both activity and selectivity by the synergy of single atom cocatalysts and oxygen vacancies.",Nature Communications
Subnanometric Cu clusters on atomically Fe-doped MoO2 for furfural upgrading to aviation biofuels,"© 2022, The Author(s).Single cluster catalysts (SCCs) are considered as versatile boosters in heterogeneous catalysis due to their modifiable single cluster sites and supports. In this work, we report subnanometric Cu clusters dispersed on Fe-doped MoO2 support for biomass-derived furfural upgrading. Systematical characterizations suggest uniform Cu clusters (composing four Cu atoms in average) are homogeneously immobilized on the atomically Fe-doped ultrafine MoO2 nanocrystals (Cu4/Fe0.3Mo0.7O2@C). The atomic doping of Fe into MoO2 leads to significantly modified electronic structure and consequently charge redistribution inside the supported Cu clusters. The as-prepared Cu4/Fe0.3Mo0.7O2@C shows superior catalytic performance in the oxidative coupling of furfural with C3~C10 primary/secondary alcohols to produce C8~C15 aldehydes/ketones (aviation biofuel intermediates), outperforming the conventionally prepared counterparts. DFT calculations and control experiments are further carried out to interpret the structural and compositional merits of Cu4/Fe0.3Mo0.7O2@C in the oxidative coupling reaction, and elucidate the reaction pathway and related intermediates.",Nature Communications
Understanding the complementarities of surface-enhanced infrared and Raman spectroscopies in CO adsorption and electrochemical reduction,"© 2022, The Author(s).In situ/operando surface enhanced infrared and Raman spectroscopies are widely employed in electrocatalysis research to extract mechanistic information and establish structure-activity relations. However, these two spectroscopic techniques are more frequently employed in isolation than in combination, owing to the assumption that they provide largely overlapping information regarding reaction intermediates. Here we show that surface enhanced infrared and Raman spectroscopies tend to probe different subpopulations of adsorbates on weakly adsorbing surfaces while providing similar information on strongly binding surfaces by conducting both techniques on the same electrode surfaces, i.e., platinum, palladium, gold and oxide-derived copper, in tandem. Complementary density functional theory computations confirm that the infrared and Raman intensities do not necessarily track each other when carbon monoxide is adsorbed on different sites, given the lack of scaling between the derivatives of the dipole moment and the polarizability. Through a comparison of adsorbed carbon monoxide and water adsorption energies, we suggest that differences in the infrared vs. Raman responses amongst metal surfaces could stem from the competitive adsorption of water on weak binding metals. We further determined that only copper sites capable of adsorbing carbon monoxide in an atop configuration visible to the surface enhanced infrared spectroscopy are active in the electrochemical carbon monoxide reduction reaction.",Nature Communications
Kinetically restrained oxygen reduction to hydrogen peroxide with nearly 100% selectivity,"© 2022, The Author(s).Hydrogen peroxide has been synthesized mainly through the electrocatalytic and photocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction in recent years. Herein, we synthesize a single-atom rhodium catalyst (Rh1/NC) to mimic the properties of flavoenzymes for the synthesis of hydrogen peroxide under mild conditions. Rh1/NC dehydrogenates various substrates and catalyzes the reduction of oxygen to hydrogen peroxide. The maximum hydrogen peroxide production rate is 0.48 mol gcatalyst−1 h−1 in the phosphorous acid aerobic oxidation reaction. We find that the selectivity of oxygen reduction to hydrogen peroxide can reach 100%. This is because a single catalytic site of Rh1/NC can only catalyze the removal of two electrons per substrate molecule; thus, the subsequent oxygen can only obtain two electrons to reduce to hydrogen peroxide through the typical two-electron pathway. Similarly, due to the restriction of substrate dehydrogenation, the hydrogen peroxide selectivity in commercial Pt/C-catalyzed enzymatic reactions can be found to reach 75%, which is 30 times higher than that in electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reactions.",Nature Communications
Theory-guided design of hydrogen-bonded cobaltoporphyrin frameworks for highly selective electrochemical H2O2 production in acid,"© 2022, The Author(s).The pursuit of selective two-electron oxygen reduction reaction to H2O2 in acids is demanding and largely hampered by the lack of efficient non-precious-metal-based electrocatalysts. Metal macrocycles hold promise, but have been relatively underexplored. Efforts are called for to promote their inherent catalytic activities and/or increase the surface exposure of active sites. In this contribution, we perform the high-throughput computational screening of thirty-two different metalloporphyrins by comparing their adsorption free energies towards key reaction intermediates. Cobalt porphyrin is revealed to be the optimal candidate with a theoretical overpotential as small as 40 mV. Guided by the computational predictions, we prepare hydrogen-bonded cobaltoporphyrin frameworks in order to promote the solution accessibility of catalytically active sites for H2O2 production in acids. The product features an onset potential at ~0.68 V, H2O2 selectivity of >90%, turnover frequency of 10.9 s−1 at 0.55 V and stability of ~30 h, the combination of which clearly renders it stand out from existing competitors for this challenging reaction.",Nature Communications

Evidence of carbon-supported porphyrins pyrolyzed for the oxygen reduction reaction keeping integrity,"© 2022, The Author(s).Fe(III) 5,10,15,20-(tetraphenyl)porphyrin chloride (FeTPP) and Co(III) 5,10,15,20-(tetraphenyl)porphyrin chloride (CoTPP) were adsorbed on carbon Vulcan and studied as electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) before and after pyrolysis. The pyrolysis process was also simulated through ab initio molecular dynamic simulations and the minimum energy path for the O2 dissociation after the interaction with the metal center of the FeTPP and CoTPP were calculated. After the pyrolysis the FeTPP showed the best performances reducing O2 completely to H2O with increased limiting current and lower overpotential. Tafel slops for the various catalysts did not change after the pyrolytic process suggesting that the mechanism for the ORR is not affected by the heat treatment. TEM images, X-ray diffraction, XPS spectroscopy, 57Fe Mössbauer, and DFT simulations, suggest that there is no breakdown of the macrocyclic complex at elevated temperatures, and that the macro cyclic geometry is preserved. Small variations in the Metal-O2 (M-O2) binding energies and the M–N bond length were observed which is attributed to the dispersive interaction between the macrocycles and the irregular surface of the Vulcan substrate induced by the heat treatment and causing better interaction with the O2 molecule. The theoretical strategy herein applied well simulate and explain the nature of the M–N–C active sites and the performances towards the ORR.",Scientific Reports
Unraveling the electronegativity-dominated intermediate adsorption on high-entropy alloy electrocatalysts,"© 2022, The Author(s).High-entropy alloys have received considerable attention in the field of catalysis due to their exceptional properties. However, few studies hitherto focus on the origin of their outstanding performance and the accurate identification of active centers. Herein, we report a conceptual and experimental approach to overcome the limitations of single-element catalysts by designing a FeCoNiXRu (X: Cu, Cr, and Mn) High-entropy alloys system with various active sites that have different adsorption capacities for multiple intermediates. The electronegativity differences between mixed elements in HEA induce significant charge redistribution and create highly active Co and Ru sites with optimized energy barriers for simultaneously stabilizing OH* and H* intermediates, which greatly enhances the efficiency of water dissociation in alkaline conditions. This work provides an in-depth understanding of the interactions between specific active sites and intermediates, which opens up a fascinating direction for breaking scaling relation issues for multistep reactions.",Nature Communications
Water coordinated on Cu(I)-based catalysts is the oxygen source in CO2 reduction to CO,"© 2022, The Author(s).Catalytic reduction of CO2 over Cu-based catalysts can produce various carbon-based products such as the critical intermediate CO, yet significant challenges remain in shedding light on the underlying mechanisms. Here, we develop a modified triple-stage quadrupole mass spectrometer to monitor the reduction of CO2 to CO in the gas phase online. Our experimental observations reveal that the coordinated H2O on Cu(I)-based catalysts promotes CO2 adsorption and reduction to CO, and the resulting efficiencies are two orders of magnitude higher than those without H2O. Isotope-labeling studies render compelling evidence that the O atom in produced CO originates from the coordinated H2O on catalysts, rather than CO2 itself. Combining experimental observations and computational calculations with density functional theory, we propose a detailed reaction mechanism of CO2 reduction to CO over Cu(I)-based catalysts with coordinated H2O. This study offers an effective method to reveal the vital roles of H2O in promoting metal catalysts to CO2 reduction.",Nature Communications
"One-pot synthesis of Au-M@SiO2 (M = Rh, Pd, Ir, Pt) core–shell nanoparticles as highly efficient catalysts for the reduction of 4-nitrophenol","© 2022, The Author(s).The conversion of p-nitrophenol (4-NP) to p-aminophenol (4-AP) is of great significance for pharmaceutical and material manufacturing. In this work, Au-M@SiO2 (M = Rh, Pd, Ir, Pt) nanoparticles (NPs) with core–shell structures, which are expected to be excellent catalysts for the transformation of 4-NP to 4-AP, were synthesized by a facile one-pot one-step method. The structure and composition of the NPs were characterized through transmission electron microscopy, X-ray powder diffraction and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Au-M@SiO2 (M = Rh, Pd, Ir, Pt) core–shell NPs showed excellent catalytic activity in the reduction of 4-NP, which is superior to most catalysts reported in the previous literature. The enhanced catalytic activity of Au-M@SiO2 core–shell NPs is presumably related to the bimetallic synergistic effect. This study provides a simple strategy to synthesize core–shell bimetallic NPs for catalytic applications.",Scientific Reports
Recent progress on two-dimensional materials confining single atoms for CO2 photoreduction,"© 2022Photoreduction of CO2 into value-added products offers a promising approach to overcome both climate change and energy crisis. However, low conversion efficiency, poor product selectivity, and unclear mechanism limit the further advancement of CO2 photoreduction. The development of two-dimensional (2D) materials and construction of single atom sites are two frontier research fields in catalysis. Combining the advantages of 2D materials and single atom sites is expected to make a breakthrough in CO2 photoreduction. In this review, we summarized the design and application, proposed challenges and opportunities, and laid a foundation for further research and application of 2D materials confining single atoms (SACs@2D) for CO2 photoreduction.",Chinese Chemical Letters
Nano-crumples induced Sn-Bi bimetallic interface pattern with moderate electron bank for highly efficient CO2 electroreduction,"© 2022, The Author(s).CO2 electroreduction reaction offers an attractive approach to global carbon neutrality. Industrial CO2 electrolysis towards formate requires stepped-up current densities, which is limited by the difficulty of precisely reconciling the competing intermediates (COOH* and HCOO*). Herein, nano-crumples induced Sn-Bi bimetallic interface-rich materials are in situ designed by tailored electrodeposition under CO2 electrolysis conditions, significantly expediting formate production. Compared with Sn-Bi bulk alloy and pure Sn, this Sn-Bi interface pattern delivers optimum upshift of Sn p-band center, accordingly the moderate valence electron depletion, which leads to weakened Sn-C hybridization of competing COOH* and suitable Sn-O hybridization of HCOO*. Superior partial current density up to 140 mA/cm2 for formate is achieved. High Faradaic efficiency (>90%) is maintained at a wide potential window with a durability of 160 h. In this work, we elevate the interface design of highly active and stable materials for efficient CO2 electroreduction.",Nature Communications
Selectively anchoring single atoms on specific sites of supports for improved oxygen evolution,"© 2022, The Author(s).The homogeneity of single-atom catalysts is only to the first-order approximation when all isolated metal centers interact identically with the support. Since the realistic support with various topologies or defects offers diverse coordination environments, realizing real homogeneity requires precise control over the anchoring sites. In this work, we selectively anchor Ir single atoms onto the three-fold hollow sites (Ir1/TO–CoOOH) and oxygen vacancies (Ir1/VO–CoOOH) on defective CoOOH surface to investigate how the anchoring sites modulate catalytic performance. The oxygen evolution activities of Ir1/TO–CoOOH and Ir1/VO–CoOOH are improved relative to CoOOH through different mechanisms. For Ir1/TO–CoOOH, the strong electronic interaction between single-atom Ir and the support modifies the electronic structure of the active center for stronger electronic affinity to intermediates. For Ir1/VO–CoOOH, a hydrogen bonding is formed between the coordinated oxygen of single-atom Ir center and the oxygenated intermediates, which stabilizes the intermediates and lowers the energy barrier of the rate-determining step.",Nature Communications
Modulating Pt-O-Pt atomic clusters with isolated cobalt atoms for enhanced hydrogen evolution catalysis,"© 2022, The Author(s).Platinum is the most efficient catalyst for hydrogen evolution reaction in acidic conditions, but its widespread use has been impeded by scarcity and high cost. Herein, Pt atomic clusters (Pt ACs) containing Pt-O-Pt units were prepared using Co/N co-doped carbon (CoNC) as support. Pt ACs are anchored to single Co atoms on CoNC by forming strong interactions. Pt-ACs/CoNC exhibits only 24 mV overpotential at 10 mA cm−2 and a high mass activity of 28.6 A mg−1 at 50 mV, which is more than 6 times higher than commercial Pt/C with any Pt loadings. Spectroscopic measurements and computational modeling reveal the enhanced hydrogen generation activity attributes to the charge redistribution between Pt and O atoms in Pt-O-Pt units, making Pt atoms the main active sites and O linkers the assistants, thus optimizing the proton adsorption and hydrogen desorption. This work opens an avenue to fabricate noble-metal-based ACs stabilized by single-atom catalysts with desired properties for electrocatalysis.",Nature Communications
CdBiO2Br nanosheets in situ strong coupling to carbonized polymer dots and improved photocatalytic activity for organic pollutants degradation,"© 2022Carbonized polymer dots (CPDs) modified layer-structured CdBiO2Br (CPDs/CdBiO2Br) Z-scheme heterojunction hybrid material has been synthesized via simple solvothermal method. The hybrid material with Z-scheme heterojunction can effectively maintain the original highly oxidizing holes of CdBiO2Br and the highly reducing electrons of CPDs. In addition, the construction of heterostructure is beneficial to the migration and separation of photogenerated carriers. Under visible light irradiation, 6 wt% CPDs/CdBiO2Br showed the best catalytic activity for degradation of organic pollutants. Free radical capture experiments and ESR analysis confirmed that the main active species are •O2− and h+. The decomposition process of organic pollutants was analyzed by LC-MS. Finally, the probable visible light mechanism performance of CPDs/CdBiO2Br as direct Z-scheme heterojunction photocatalytic materials was proposed.",Chinese Chemical Letters
Breaking adsorption-energy scaling limitations of electrocatalytic nitrate reduction on intermetallic CuPd nanocubes by machine-learned insights,"© 2022, The Author(s).The electrochemical nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR) to ammonia is an essential step toward restoring the globally disrupted nitrogen cycle. In search of highly efficient electrocatalysts, tailoring catalytic sites with ligand and strain effects in random alloys is a common approach but remains limited due to the ubiquitous energy-scaling relations. With interpretable machine learning, we unravel a mechanism of breaking adsorption-energy scaling relations through the site-specific Pauli repulsion interactions of the metal d-states with adsorbate frontier orbitals. The non-scaling behavior can be realized on (100)-type sites of ordered B2 intermetallics, in which the orbital overlap between the hollow *N and subsurface metal atoms is significant while the bridge-bidentate *NO3 is not directly affected. Among those intermetallics predicted, we synthesize monodisperse ordered B2 CuPd nanocubes that demonstrate high performance for NO3RR to ammonia with a Faradaic efficiency of 92.5% at −0.5 VRHE and a yield rate of 6.25 mol h−1 g−1 at −0.6 VRHE. This study provides machine-learned design rules besides the d-band center metrics, paving the path toward data-driven discovery of catalytic materials beyond linear scaling limitations.",Nature Communications
Oxygen Evolution Reaction in Energy Conversion and Storage: Design Strategies Under and Beyond the Energy Scaling Relationship,"© 2022, The Author(s).The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is the essential module in energy conversion and storage devices such as electrolyzer, rechargeable metal–air batteries and regenerative fuel cells. The adsorption energy scaling relations between the reaction intermediates, however, impose a large intrinsic overpotential and sluggish reaction kinetics on OER catalysts. Developing advanced electrocatalysts with high activity and stability based on non-noble metal materials is still a grand challenge. Central to the rational design of novel and high-efficiency catalysts is the development and understanding of quantitative structure–activity relationships, which correlate the catalytic activities with structural and electronic descriptors. This paper comprehensively reviews the benchmark descriptors for OER electrolysis, aiming to give an in-depth understanding on the origins of the electrocatalytic activity of the OER and further contribute to building the theory of electrocatalysis. Meanwhile, the cutting-edge research frontiers for proposing new OER paradigms and crucial strategies to circumvent the scaling relationship are also summarized. Challenges, opportunities and perspectives are discussed, intending to shed some light on the rational design concepts and advance the development of more efficient catalysts for enhancing OER performance.

Emergence of local scaling relations in adsorption energies on high-entropy alloys,"© 2022, This is a U.S. government work and not under copyright protection in the U.S.; foreign copyright protection may apply.Alloying has been proposed to circumvent scaling relations between the adsorption energies thus allowing for the complete optimization of multistep reactions. Herein the fidelity of scaling rules on high-entropy alloy (HEA) surfaces is assessed focusing on hydrogen-containing molecules, *AHx for A = C and N (x = 0, 1, 2, 3), A = S (x = 0, 1, 2) and A = O (x = 0, 1). Using an adsorbate- and site-specific deep learning model to rapidly compute the adsorption energies on CoMoFeNiCu HEA surfaces, the energies of *AHx and *A are shown to be linearly correlated if *A and *AHx have identical adsorption site symmetry. However, a local linear dependence emerges between the configuration-averaged adsorption energies irrespective of the site symmetry. Although these correlations represent a weaker form of the scaling relationships, they are sufficient to prohibit the optimization of multistep reactions. The underpinning of this behavior is twofold (1) the nearsightedness principle and (2) the narrow distribution of the adsorption energies around the mean-field value. While the nearsightedness is general for all electronic systems, the second criterion applies in HEAs with relatively strong reactive elements. The present findings strongly suggest that alloys may not generally enable the breaking of scaling relationships.",npj Computational Materials
Efficient and stable noble-metal-free catalyst for acidic water oxidation,"© 2022, The Author(s).Developing non-noble catalysts with superior activity and durability for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in acidic media is paramount for hydrogen production from water. Still, challenges remain due to the inadequate activity and stability of the OER catalyst. Here, we report a cost-effective and stable manganese oxybromide (Mn7.5O10Br3) catalyst exhibiting an excellent OER activity in acidic electrolytes, with an overpotential of as low as 295 ± 5 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm−2. Mn7.5O10Br3 maintains good stability under operating conditions for at least 500 h. In situ Raman spectroscopy, X ray absorption near edge spectroscopy, and density functional theory calculations confirm that a self-oxidized surface with enhanced electronic transmission capacity forms on Mn7.5O10Br3 and is responsible for both the high catalytic activity and long-term stability during catalysis. The development of Mn7.5O10Br3 as an OER catalyst provides crucial insights into the design of non-noble metal electrocatalysts for water oxidation.",Nature Communications
Activating lattice oxygen in NiFe-based (oxy)hydroxide for water electrolysis,"© 2022, The Author(s).Transition metal oxides or (oxy)hydroxides have been intensively investigated as promising electrocatalysts for energy and environmental applications. Oxygen in the lattice was reported recently to actively participate in surface reactions. Herein, we report a sacrificial template-directed approach to synthesize Mo-doped NiFe (oxy)hydroxide with modulated oxygen activity as an enhanced electrocatalyst towards oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The obtained MoNiFe (oxy)hydroxide displays a high mass activity of 1910 A/gmetal at the overpotential of 300 mV. The combination of density functional theory calculations and advanced spectroscopy techniques suggests that the Mo dopant upshifts the O 2p band and weakens the metal-oxygen bond of NiFe (oxy)hydroxide, facilitating oxygen vacancy formation and shifting the reaction pathway for OER. Our results provide critical insights into the role of lattice oxygen in determining the activity of (oxy)hydroxides and demonstrate tuning oxygen activity as a promising approach for constructing highly active electrocatalysts.",Nature Communications
Golgi apparatus-targeted aggregation-induced emission luminogens for effective cancer photodynamic therapy,"© 2022, The Author(s).Golgi apparatus (GA) oxidative stress induced by in situ reactive oxygen species (ROS) could severely damage the morphology and function of GA, which may open up an avenue for effective photodynamic therapy (PDT). However, due to the lack of effective design strategy, photosensitizers (PSs) with specific GA targeting ability are in high demand and yet quite challenging. Herein, we report an aggregation-induced emission luminogen (AIEgen) based PS (TPE-PyT-CPS) that can effectively target the GA via caveolin/raft mediated endocytosis with a Pearson correlation coefficient up to 0.98. Additionally, the introduction of pyrene into TPE-PyT-CPS can reduce the energy gap between the lowest singlet state (S1) and the lowest triplet state (T1) (ΔEST) and exhibits enhanced singlet oxygen generation capability. GA fragmentation and cleavage of GA proteins (p115/GM130) are observed upon light irradiation. Meanwhile, the apoptotic pathway is activated through a crosstalk between GA oxidative stress and mitochondria in HeLa cells. More importantly, GA targeting TPE-T-CPS show better PDT effect than its non-GA-targeting counterpart TPE-PyT-PS, even though they possess very close ROS generation rate. This work provides a strategy for the development of PSs with specific GA targeting ability, which is of great importance for precise and effective PDT.",Nature Communications
Insights into the activity of single-atom Fe-N-C catalysts for oxygen reduction reaction,"© 2022, The Author(s).Single-atom Fe-N-C catalysts has attracted widespread attentions in the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). However, the origin of ORR activity on Fe-N-C catalysts is still unclear, which hinder the further improvement of Fe-N-C catalysts. Herein, we provide a model to understand the ORR activity of Fe-N4 site from the spatial structure and energy level of the frontier orbitals by density functional theory calculations. Taking the regulation of divacancy defects on Fe-N4 site ORR activity as examples, we demonstrate that the hybridization between Fe 3dz2, 3dyz (3dxz) and O2 π* orbitals is the origin of Fe-N4 ORR activity. We found that the Fe–O bond length, the d-band center gap of spin states, the magnetic moment of Fe site and *O2 as descriptors can accurately predict the ORR activity of Fe-N4 site. Furthermore, these descriptors and ORR activity of Fe-N4 site are mainly distributed in two regions with obvious difference, which greatly relate to the height of Fe 3d projected orbital in the Z direction. This work provides a new insight into the ORR activity of single-atom M-N-C catalysts.",Nature Communications
Active and conductive layer stacked superlattices for highly selective CO2 electroreduction,"© 2022, The Author(s).Metal oxides are archetypal CO2 reduction reaction electrocatalysts, yet inevitable self-reduction will enhance competitive hydrogen evolution and lower the CO2 electroreduction selectivity. Herein, we propose a tangible superlattice model of alternating metal oxides and selenide sublayers in which electrons are rapidly exported through the conductive metal selenide layer to protect the active oxide layer from self-reduction. Taking BiCuSeO superlattices as a proof-of-concept, a comprehensive characterization reveals that the active [Bi2O2]2+ sublayers retain oxidation states rather than their self-reduced Bi metal during CO2 electroreduction because of the rapid electron transfer through the conductive [Cu2Se2]2- sublayer. Theoretical calculations uncover the high activity over [Bi2O2]2+ sublayers due to the overlaps between the Bi p orbitals and O p orbitals in the OCHO* intermediate, thus achieving over 90% formate selectivity in a wide potential range from −0.4 to −1.1 V. This work broadens the studying and improving of the CO2 electroreduction properties of metal oxide systems.",Nature Communications
Engineering a local acid-like environment in alkaline medium for efficient hydrogen evolution reaction,"© 2022, The Author(s).Tuning the local reaction environment is an important and challenging issue for determining electrochemical performances. Herein, we propose a strategy of intentionally engineering the local reaction environment to yield highly active catalysts. Taking Ptδ− nanoparticles supported on oxygen vacancy enriched MgO nanosheets as a prototypical example, we have successfully created a local acid-like environment in the alkaline medium and achieve excellent hydrogen evolution reaction performances. The local acid-like environment is evidenced by operando Raman, synchrotron radiation infrared and X-ray absorption spectroscopy that observes a key H3O+ intermediate emergence on the surface of MgO and accumulation around Ptδ− sites during electrocatalysis. Further analysis confirms that the critical factors of the forming the local acid-like environment include: the oxygen vacancy enriched MgO facilitates H2O dissociation to generate H3O+ species; the F centers of MgO transfers its unpaired electrons to Pt, leading to the formation of electron-enriched Ptδ− species; positively charged H3O+ migrates to negatively charged Ptδ− and accumulates around Ptδ− nanoparticles due to the electrostatic attraction, thus creating a local acidic environment in the alkaline medium.",Nature Communications
Heterogenous nanocomposite catalysts with rhenium nanostructures for the catalytic reduction of 4-nitrophenol,"© 2022, The Author(s).Stable and efficient heterogenous nanocatalysts for the reduction of 4-nitrophenol (4-NP) has attracted much attention in recent years. In this context, a unique and efficient in situ approach is used for the production of new polymeric nanocomposites (pNCs) containing rhenium nanostructures (ReNSs). These rare materials should facilitate the catalytic decomposition of 4-NP, in turn ensuring increased catalytic activity and stability. These nanomaterials were analyzed using Fourier-Transformation Infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and X-ray powder diffraction (XRD). The efficiency of the catalytic reaction was estimated based on the acquired UV–Vis spectra, which enabled the estimation of the catalytic activity using pseud-first order modelling. The applied method resulted in the successful production and efficient loading of ReNSs in the polymeric matrices. Amino functionalities played a primary role in the reduction process. Moreover, the functionality that is derived from 1.1′-carbonyl imidazole improved the availability of the ReNSs, which resulted in 90% conversion of 4-NP with a maximum rate constant of 0.29 min−1 over 11 subsequent catalytic cycles. This effect was observed despite the trace amount of Re in the pNCs (~ 5%), suggesting a synergistic effect between the polymeric base and the ReNSs-based catalyst.",Scientific Reports
Hydrothermal synthesized delafossite CuGaO2 as an electrocatalyst for water oxidation,"© 2022, The Author(s).Hydrogen production from water splitting provides an effective method to alleviate the ever-growing global energy crisis. In this work, delafossite CuGaO2 (CGO) crystal was synthesized through hydrothermal routes with Cu(NO3)2·3H2O and Ga(NO3)3·xH2O used as reactants. The addition of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) was found to play an important role in modifying the morphology of CuGaO2 (CGO-CTAB). With the addition of CTAB, the morphology of CGO-CTAB samples changed from irregular flake to typical hexagonal sheet microstructure, with an average size of 1–2 μm and a thickness of around 100 nm. Furthermore, the electrocatalytic activity of CGO-CTAB crystals for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) was also studied and compared with that of CGO crystals. CGO-CTAB samples exhibited better activity than CGO. An overpotential of 391.5 mV was shown to be able to generate a current density of 10 mA/cm2. The as-prepared samples also demonstrate good stability for water oxidation and relatively fast OER kinetics with a Tafel slope of 56.4 mV/dec. This work highlights the significant role of modification of CTAB surfactants in preparing CGO related crystals, and the introduction of CTAB was found to help to improve their electrocatalytic activity for OER.

In situ dual doping for constructing efficient CO2-to-methanol electrocatalysts,"© 2022, The Author(s).Methanol is a highly desirable product of CO2 electroreduction due to its wide array of industrial applications. However, the development of CO2-to-methanol electrocatalysts with high performance is still challenging. Here we report an operationally simple in situ dual doping strategy to construct efficient CO2-to-methanol electrocatalysts. In particular, when using Ag,S-Cu2O/Cu as electrocatalyst, the methanol Faradaic efficiency (FE) could reach 67.4% with a current density as high as 122.7 mA cm−2 in an H-type cell using 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate/H2O as the electrolyte, while the current density was below 50 mA cm−2 when the FE was greater than 50% over the reported catalysts. Experimental and theoretical studies suggest that the anion S can effectively adjust the electronic structure and morphology of the catalysts in favor of the methanol pathway, whereas the cation Ag suppresses the hydrogen evolution reaction. Their synergistic interactions with host material enhance the selectivity and current density for methanol formation. This work opens a way for designing efficient catalysts for CO2 electroreduction to methanol.",Nature Communications
Substrate effect on hydrogen evolution reaction in two-dimensional Mo2C monolayers,"© 2022, The Author(s).The physical and chemical properties of atomically thin two-dimensional (2D) materials can be modified by the substrates. In this study, the substrate effect on the electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in 2D Mo2C monolayers was investigated using first principles calculations. The isolated Mo2C monolayer shows large variation in HER activity depending on hydrogen coverage: it has relatively low activity at low hydrogen coverage but high activity at high hydrogen coverage. Among Ag, Au, Cu, and graphene substrates, the HER activity is improved on the Ag and Cu substrates especially at low hydrogen coverage, while the effects of the Au and graphene substrates on the HER activity are insignificant. The improvement is caused by the charge redistribution in the Mo2C layer on the substrate, and therefore the HER activity becomes high for any hydrogen coverage on the Ag and Cu substrates. Our results suggest that, in two-dimensional electrocatalysis, the substrate has a degree of freedom to tune the catalytic activity.",Scientific Reports
High-Energy Batteries: Beyond Lithium-Ion and Their Long Road to Commercialisation,"© 2022, The Author(s).Rechargeable batteries of high energy density and overall performance are becoming a critically important technology in the rapidly changing society of the twenty-first century. While lithium-ion batteries have so far been the dominant choice, numerous emerging applications call for higher capacity, better safety and lower costs while maintaining sufficient cyclability. The design space for potentially better alternatives is extremely large, with numerous new chemistries and architectures being simultaneously explored. These include other insertion ions (e.g. sodium and numerous multivalent ions), conversion electrode materials (e.g. silicon, metallic anodes, halides and chalcogens) and aqueous and solid electrolytes. However, each of these potential “beyond lithium-ion” alternatives faces numerous challenges that often lead to very poor cyclability, especially at the commercial cell level, while lithium-ion batteries continue to improve in performance and decrease in cost. This review examines fundamental principles to rationalise these numerous developments, and in each case, a brief overview is given on the advantages, advances, remaining challenges preventing cell-level implementation and the state-of-the-art of the solutions to these challenges. Finally, research and development results obtained in academia are compared to emerging commercial examples, as a commentary on the current and near-future viability of these “beyond lithium-ion” alternatives.[Figure not available: see fulltext.]",Nano-Micro Letters
Efficient iron single-atom catalysts for selective ammoxidation of alcohols to nitriles,"© 2022, The Author(s).Zeolitic imidazolate frameworks derived Fe1-N-C catalysts with isolated single iron atoms have been synthesized and applied for selective ammoxidation reactions. For the preparation of the different Fe-based materials, benzylamine as an additive proved to be essential to tune the morphology and size of ZIFs resulting in uniform and smaller particles, which allow stable atomically dispersed Fe–N4 active sites. The optimal catalyst Fe1-N-C achieves an efficient synthesis of various aryl, heterocyclic, allylic, and aliphatic nitriles from alcohols in water under very mild conditions. With its chemoselectivity, recyclability, high efficiency under mild conditions this new system complements the toolbox of catalysts for nitrile synthesis, which are important intermediates with many applications in life sciences and industry.",Nature Communications
Dual-phase MoS2/MXene/CNT ternary nanohybrids for efficient electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution,"© 2022, This is a U.S. government work and not under copyright protection in the U.S.; foreign copyright protection may apply.Two-dimensional (2D) molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) has been recognized as a potential substitution of platinum (Pt) for electrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). However, the broad adoption of MoS2 is hindered by its limited number of active sites and low inherent electrical conductivity. In this work, we employed a one-step solvothermal synthesis technique to construct a ternary hybrid structure consisting of dual-phase MoS2, titanium carbide (Ti3C2) MXene, and carbon nanotubes (CNTs), and demonstrated synergistic effects for active site exposure, surface area enlargement, and electrical conductivity improvement of the catalyst. The dual-phase MoS2 (DP-MoS2) is directly formed on the MXene with CNTs acting as crosslinks between 2D islands. The existence of edge-enriched metallic phase MoS2, the conductive backbone of MXene along with the crosslink function of CNTs clearly improves the overall HER performance of the ternary nanocomposite. Moreover, the integration of MoS2 with MXene not only increases the interlayer distance of the 2D layers but also partially suppresses the MXene oxidation and the 2D layer restacking, leading to good catalytic stability. As a result, an overpotential of 169 mV and a low Tafel slope of 51 mV/dec was successfully achieved. This work paves a way for 2D-based electrocatalyst engineering and sheds light on the development of the next-generation noble metal-free HER electrocatalysts.",npj 2D Materials and Applications
Quantum point defects in 2D materials - the QPOD database,"© 2022, The Author(s).Atomically thin two-dimensional (2D) materials are ideal host systems for quantum defects as they offer easier characterisation, manipulation and read-out of defect states as compared to bulk defects. Here we introduce the Quantum Point Defect (QPOD) database with more than 1900 defect systems comprising various charge states of 503 intrinsic point defects (vacancies and antisites) in 82 different 2D semiconductors and insulators. The Atomic Simulation Recipes (ASR) workflow framework was used to perform density functional theory (DFT) calculations of defect formation energies, charge transition levels, Fermi level positions, equilibrium defect and carrier concentrations, transition dipole moments, hyperfine coupling, and zero-field splitting. Excited states and photoluminescence spectra were calculated for selected high-spin defects. In this paper we describe the calculations and workflow behind the QPOD database, present an overview of its content, and discuss some general trends and correlations in the data. We analyse the degree of defect tolerance as well as intrinsic dopability of the host materials and identify promising defects for quantum technological applications. The database is freely available and can be browsed via a web-app interlinked with the Computational 2D Materials Database (C2DB).",npj Computational Materials
"N, O-coupling towards the selectively electrochemical production of H2O2","© 2022Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) synthesis generally involves the energy-intensive anthraquinone process. Alternatively, electrochemical synthesis provides a green, economical, and environmentally friendly route to prepare H2O2 via the two-electron oxygen reduction reaction, but this process requires efficient catalysts with high activity and selectivity simultaneously. Here, we report an N, O co-doped carbon xerogel-based electrocatalyst (NO-CX) prepared by a simple and economical method. The NO-CX catalyst exhibits a high H2O2 selectivity over 90% in a potential range of 0.2–0.6 V and a high H2O2 production rate of 1410 mmol gcat−1 h−1. The density functional theory calculations demonstrate that the coupling effect between N and O can effectively induce the redistribution of surface charge and the edge carbon atom adjacent to an ether group and a graphite nitrogen atom is the active site. This work provides a straightforward and low-cost process to produce highly selective H2O2 catalysts, which is in place for the expansion of electrocatalytic synthesis of useful chemicals.",Chinese Chemical Letters
Conversion of Catalytically Inert 2D Bismuth Oxide Nanosheets for Effective Electrochemical Hydrogen Evolution Reaction Catalysis via Oxygen Vacancy Concentration Modulation,"© 2022, The Author(s).Oxygen vacancies (V o) in electrocatalysts are closely correlated with the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity. The role of vacancy defects and the effect of their concentration, however, yet remains unclear. Herein, Bi2O3, an unfavorable electrocatalyst for the HER due to a less than ideal hydrogen adsorption Gibbs free energy (ΔG H*), is utilized as a perfect model to explore the function of V o on HER performance. Through a facile plasma irradiation strategy, Bi2O3 nanosheets with different V o concentrations are fabricated to evaluate the influence of defects on the HER process. Unexpectedly, while the generated oxygen vacancies contribute to the enhanced HER performance, higher V o concentrations beyond a saturation value result in a significant drop in HER activity. By tunning the V o concentration in the Bi2O3 nanosheets via adjusting the treatment time, the Bi2O3 catalyst with an optimized oxygen vacancy concentration and detectable charge carrier concentration of 1.52 × 1024 cm−3 demonstrates enhanced HER performance with an overpotential of 174.2 mV to reach 10 mA cm−2, a Tafel slope of 80 mV dec−1, and an exchange current density of 316 mA cm−2 in an alkaline solution, which approaches the top-tier activity among Bi-based HER electrocatalysts. Density-functional theory calculations confirm the preferred adsorption of H* onto Bi2O3 as a function of oxygen chemical potential (∆μ O) and oxygen partial potential (P O2) and reveal that high V o concentrations result in excessive stability of adsorbed hydrogen and hence the inferior HER activity. This study reveals the oxygen vacancy concentration-HER catalytic activity relationship and provides insights into activating catalytically inert materials into highly efficient electrocatalysts.[Figure not available: see fulltext.]",Nano-Micro Letters
Pseudo-adsorption and long-range redox coupling during oxygen reduction reaction on single atom electrocatalyst,"© 2022, The Author(s).Fundamental understanding of the dynamic behaviors at the electrochemical interface is crucial for electrocatalyst design and optimization. Here, we revisit the oxygen reduction reaction mechanism on a series of transition metal (M = Fe, Co, Ni, Cu) single atom sites embedded in N-doped nanocarbon by ab initio molecular dynamics simulations with explicit solvation. We have identified the dissociative pathways and the thereby emerged solvated hydroxide species for all the proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) steps at the electrochemical interface. Such hydroxide species can be dynamically confined in a “pseudo-adsorption” state at a few water layers away from the active site and respond to the redox event at the catalytic center in a coupled manner within timescale less than 1 ps. In the PCET steps, the proton species (in form of hydronium in neutral/acidic media or water in alkaline medium) can protonate the pseudo-adsorbed hydroxide without needing to travel to the direct catalyst surface. This, therefore, expands the reactive region beyond the direct catalyst surface, boosting the reaction kinetics via alleviating mass transfer limits. Our work implies that in catalysis the reaction species may not necessarily bind to the catalyst surface but be confined in an active region.",Nature Communications
"Recent advances in single-crystalline two-dimensional polymers: Synthesis, characterization and challenges","© 2022Two-dimensional polymers (2DPs) are emerging crystalline 2D organic material comprising free-standing, single-atom/monomer-thick, planar, and covalent networks with long-ranging structural order. Benefiting from their intrinsic porosity, crystallinity, and electrical properties, 2DPs have displayed great potential for separation, energy conversion and electronic fields.

Finally, we will present the current challenges and trends regarding the future developments of crystallinity, monomer design, synthesis strategy and characterization.",Chinese Chemical Letters
Highly efficient and selective electrocatalytic hydrogen peroxide production on Co-O-C active centers on graphene oxide,"© 2022, The Author(s).Electrochemical oxygen reduction provides an eco-friendly synthetic route to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), a widely used green chemical. However, the kinetically sluggish and low-selectivity oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is a key challenge to electrochemical production of H2O2 for practical applications. Herein, we demonstrate that single cobalt atoms anchored on oxygen functionalized graphene oxide form Co-O-C@GO active centres (abbreviated as Co1@GO for simplicity) that act as an efficient and durable electrocatalyst for H2O2 production. This Co1@GO electrocatalyst shows excellent electrochemical performance in O2-saturated 0.1 M KOH, exhibiting high reactivity with an onset potential of 0.91 V and H2O2 production of 1.0 mg cm−2 h−1 while affording high selectivity of 81.4% for H2O2. Our combined experimental observations and theoretical calculations indicate that the high reactivity and selectivity of Co1@GO for H2O2 electrogeneration arises from a synergistic effect between the O-bonded single Co atoms and adjacent oxygen functional groups (C-O bonds) of the GO present in the Co-O-C active centres.",Communications Chemistry
Atomic-precision Pt6 nanoclusters for enhanced hydrogen electro-oxidation,"© 2022, The Author(s).The discord between the insufficient abundance and the excellent electrocatalytic activity of Pt urgently requires its atomic-level engineering for minimal Pt dosage yet maximized electrocatalytic performance. Here we report the design of ultrasmall triphenylphosphine-stabilized Pt6 nanoclusters for electrocatalytic hydrogen oxidation reaction in alkaline solution. Benefiting from the self-optimized ligand effect and atomic-precision structure, the nanocluster electrocatalyst demonstrates a high mass activity, a high stability, and outperforms both Pt single atoms and Pt nanoparticle analogues, uncovering an unexpected size optimization principle for designing Pt electrocatalysts. Moreover, the nanocluster electrocatalyst delivers a high CO-tolerant ability that conventional Pt/C catalyst lacks. Theoretical calculations confirm that the enhanced electrocatalytic performance is attributable to the bifold effects of the triphenylphosphine ligand, which can not only tune the formation of atomically precise platinum nanoclusters, but also shift the d-band center of Pt atoms for favorable adsorption kinetics of *H, *OH, and CO.",Nature Communications
Controllable tuning of polymetallic Co-Ni-Ru-S-Se ultrathin nanosheets to boost electrocatalytic oxygen evolution,"© 2022, The Author(s).Replacing precious metals in oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts has broad prospects to achieve a viable water splitting system. Since the electrocatalytic OER is a four-electron transfer reaction with a very sluggish kinetic process, there is great interest in the development of inexpensive, durable, and high-efficiency OER catalysts. Herein, trimetallic Co-Ni-Ru sulfoselenide and bimetallic sulfoselenide nanosheets were designed by regulating their composition and morphology for efficient and durable OER electrocatalysis. The sheet structure has a large specific surface area to promote contact between the catalyst and electrolyte. Compared with bimetallic Co-Ni, Co-Ru, Ni-Ru, Co-Cd, and Co-Au sulfoselenide nanosheets, trimetallic Co-Ni-Ru sulfoselenide nanosheets show superior OER performance. By modulating the composition ratio of metal atoms in the Co-Ni-Ru-S-Se nanosheets (1:1:0.5:1:1), the nanosheets showed a significant OER overpotential of η = 261 mV (1.491 V versus RHE) at 10 mA cm−2, a Tafel slope of 52.2 mV dec–1 and outstanding stability after 48 h of continuous testing. For comparison, Co-Ni, Co-Ru, Ni-Ru, Co-Cd, and Co-Au bimetallic sulfoselenide nanosheets (denoted as Co-Ni-S-Se, Co-Ru-S-Se, Ni-Ru-S-Se, Co-Au-S-Se, Co-Cd-S-Se) were also tested. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations showed that appropriately doping Ru and Ni simultaneously (Co-Ni-Ru-S-Se) can increase the density of the states at the Fermi level, resulting in excellent charge density and low intermediate adsorption energy. These findings present a practical route to design 2D polymetallic nanosheets to optimize catalytic OER performance.",NPG Asia Materials
Mismatching integration-enabled strains and defects engineering in LDH microstructure for high-rate and long-life charge storage,"© 2022, The Author(s).Layered double hydroxides (LDH) have been extensively investigated for charge storage, however, their development is hampered by the sluggish reaction dynamics. Herein, triggered by mismatching integration of Mn sites, we configured wrinkled Mn/NiCo-LDH with strains and defects, where promoted mass & charge transport behaviors were realized. The well-tailored Mn/NiCo-LDH displays a capacity up to 518 C g−1 (1 A g−1), a remarkable rate performance (78%@100 A g−1) and a long cycle life (without capacity decay after 10,000 cycles). We clarified that the moderate electron transfer between the released Mn species and Co2+ serves as the pre-step, while the compressive strain induces structural deformation with promoted reaction dynamics. Theoretical and operando investigations further demonstrate that the Mn sites boost ion adsorption/transport and electron transfer, and the Mn-induced effect remains active after multiple charge/discharge processes. This contribution provides some insights for controllable structure design and modulation toward high-efficient energy storage.",Nature Communications
Complementary Operando Spectroscopy identification of in-situ generated metastable charge-asymmetry Cu2-CuN3 clusters for CO2 reduction to ethanol,"© 2022, The Author(s).Copper-based materials can reliably convert carbon dioxide into multi-carbon products but they suffer from poor activity and product selectivity. The atomic structure-activity relationship of electrocatalysts for the selectivity is controversial due to the lacking of systemic multiple dimensions for operando condition study. Herein, we synthesized high-performance CO2RR catalyst comprising of CuO clusters supported on N-doped carbon nanosheets, which exhibited high C2+ products Faradaic efficiency of 73% including decent ethanol selectivity of 51% with a partial current density of 14.4 mA/cm−2 at −1.1 V vs. RHE. We evidenced catalyst restructuring and tracked the variation of the active states under reaction conditions, presenting the atomic structure-activity relationship of this catalyst. Operando XAS, XANES simulations and Quasi-in-situ XPS analyses identified a reversible potential-dependent transformation from dispersed CuO clusters to Cu2-CuN3 clusters which are the optimal sites. This cluster can’t exist without the applied potential. The N-doping dispersed the reduced Cun clusters uniformly and maintained excellent stability and high activity with adjusting the charge distribution between the Cu atoms and N-doped carbon interface. By combining Operando FTIR and DFT calculations, it was recognized that the Cu2-CuN3 clusters displayed charge-asymmetric sites which were intensified by CH3* adsorbing, beneficial to the formation of the high-efficiency asymmetric ethanol.",Nature Communications
The synergistic effect of Hf-O-Ru bonds and oxygen vacancies in Ru/HfO2 for enhanced hydrogen evolution,"© 2022, The Author(s).Ru nanoparticles have been demonstrated to be highly active electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). At present, most of Ru nanoparticles-based HER electrocatalysts with high activity are supported by heteroatom-doped carbon substrates. Few metal oxides with large band gap (more than 5 eV) as the substrates of Ru nanoparticles are employed for the HER. By using large band gap metal oxides substrates, we can distinguish the contribution of Ru nanoparticles from the substrates. Here, a highly efficient Ru/HfO2 composite is developed by tuning numbers of Ru-O-Hf bonds and oxygen vacancies, resulting in a 20-fold enhancement in mass activity over commercial Pt/C in an alkaline medium. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that strong metal-support interaction via Ru-O-Hf bonds and the oxygen vacancies in the supported Ru samples synergistically lower the energy barrier for water dissociation to improve catalytic activities.",Nature Communications
Novel Ti3C2Tx MXene nanozyme with manageable catalytic activity and application to electrochemical biosensor,"© 2022, The Author(s).In this work, Ti3C2Tx MXene was identified as efficient nanozyme with area-dependent electrocatalytic activity in oxidation of phenolic compounds, which originated from the strong adsorption effect between the phenolic hydroxyl group and the oxygen atom on the surface of Ti3C2Tx MXene flake. On the basis of the novel electrocatalytic activity, Ti3C2Tx MXene was combined with alkaline phosphatase to construct a novel cascading catalytic amplification strategy using 1-naphthyl phosphate (1-NPP) as substrate, thereby realizing efficient electrochemical signal amplification. Taking advantage of the novel cascading catalytic amplification strategy, an electrochemical biosensor was fabricated for BCR/ABL fusion gene detection, which achieved excellent sensitivity with linear range from 0.2 fM to 20 nM and limit of detection down to 0.05 fM. This biosensor provided a promising tool for ultrasensitive fusion gene detection in early diagnosis of chronic myelogenous leukemia and acute lymphocytic leukemia. Moreover, the manageable catalytic activity of MXene broke a path for developing nanozymes, which possessed enormous application potential in not only electrochemical analysis but also the extensive fields including organic synthesis, pollutant disposal and so on.

Structural and electronic properties of Pt modified Au(100) surface,"© 2022, The Author(s).Investigations on electronic and geometric structures of platinum adsorbed on monocrystalline gold surfaces are important for understanding the remarkable catalytic properties of bimetallic Pt–Au systems. Herein, the morphology of quasi-hexagonal (hex) Au(100) surface after deposition of platinum for coverage up to 0.5 monolayer (ML) has been investigated by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). For coverage range 0.2–0.4 ML the creation of elongated islands with mono-atomic height is observed. The islands consist of flat phase of disordered Pt-Au alloy which coexists with nanowire-like features with a hex atom arrangement and quantized width. Annealing the Pt/Au(100) system at 100–150 °C changes the surface morphology. The islands disappear and the topmost layer of the surface consists of flat phase of Pt–Au alloy which coexists with the hex-stripes. Small domains of ordered c(2 × 2) structure of Pt–Au alloy are found. The electronic properties of this structure have been investigated by ab-initio calculations. The obtained results allow to distinguish the Pt from Au atoms by their appearance in the STM images. The calculated electronic structures indicate a bonding creation between Pt and Au atoms and an electron d-states redistribution of Pt in comparison to the bare Pt(100)-(1 × 1) surface.",Scientific Reports
"Chemical vapor deposition-grown nitrogen-doped graphene’s synthesis, characterization and applications","© 2022, The Author(s).The physical properties of carbon materials can be altered by doping. For instance, the electronic properties of graphene can be modulated by controlling the substitutional doping of the carbon lattice with N. In addition, C–N bonding configurations with three ring types are recognized: pyridinic-N, pyrrolic-N, and graphitic-N. Controlling the type and relative density of various types of substitutional N is an important objective that requires an extremely high level of precision when the atomic lattice is constructed. This control can be accomplished only via bottom-up methods, such as chemical vapor deposition (CVD). The number of reports on N-doped graphene (NDG) grown via CVD has increased over the past decade, but a reliable wafer-scale production strategy that can realize the desired atomic-precision growth of NDG is still lacking. To identify the most promising strategies and analyze the consistency of the results published in the literature, we review the CVD growth and characterization of two-dimensional NDG and two of the most popular applications of NDG films: field-effect transistors and energy storage devices.",npj 2D Materials and Applications
Multiscale simulation approach to investigate the binder distribution in catalyst layers of high-temperature polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells,"© 2022, The Author(s).A multiscale approach involving both density functional theory (DFT) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations was used to deduce an appropriate binder for Pt/C in the catalyst layers of high-temperature polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells. The DFT calculations showed that the sulfonic acid (SO3−) group has higher adsorption energy than the other functional groups of the binders, as indicated by its normalized adsorption area on Pt (− 0.1078 eV/Å2) and carbon (− 0.0608 eV/Å2) surfaces. Consequently, MD simulations were performed with Nafion binders as well as polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) binders at binder contents ranging from 14.2 to 25.0 wt% on a Pt/C model with H3PO4 at room temperature (298.15 K) and operating temperature (433.15 K). The pair correlation function analysis showed that the intensity of phosphorus atoms in phosphoric acid around Pt (ρPgPt - P(r)) increased with increasing temperature because of the greater mobility and miscibility of H3PO4 at 433.15 K than at 298.15 K. The coordination numbers (CNs) of Pt–P(H3PO4) gradually decreased with increasing ratio of the Nafion binders until the Nafion binder ratio reached 50%, indicating that the adsorption of H3PO4 onto the Pt surface decreased because of the high adsorption energy of SO3− groups with Pt. However, the CNs of Pt–P(H3PO4) gradually increased when the Nafion binder ratio was greater than 50% because excess Nafion binder agglomerated with itself via its SO3− groups. Surface coverage analysis showed that the carbon surface coverage by H3PO4 decreased as the overall binder content was increased to 20.0 wt% at both 298.15 and 433.15 K. The Pt surface coverage by H3PO4 at 433.15 K reached its lowest value when the PTFE and Nafion binders were present in equal ratios and at an overall binder content of 25.0 wt%. At the Pt (lower part) surface covered by H3PO4 at 433.15 K, an overall binder content of at least 20.0 wt% and equal proportions of PTFE and Nafion binder are needed to minimize H3PO4 contact with the Pt.",Scientific Reports
Hydrogen spillover in complex oxide multifunctional sites improves acidic hydrogen evolution electrocatalysis,"© 2022, The Author(s).Improving the catalytic efficiency of platinum for the hydrogen evolution reaction is valuable for water splitting technologies. Hydrogen spillover has emerged as a new strategy in designing binary-component Pt/support electrocatalysts. However, such binary catalysts often suffer from a long reaction pathway, undesirable interfacial barrier, and complicated synthetic processes. Here we report a single-phase complex oxide La2Sr2PtO7+δ as a high-performance hydrogen evolution electrocatalyst in acidic media utilizing an atomic-scale hydrogen spillover effect between multifunctional catalytic sites. With insights from comprehensive experiments and theoretical calculations, the overall hydrogen evolution pathway proceeds along three steps: fast proton adsorption on O site, facile hydrogen migration from O site to Pt site via thermoneutral La-Pt bridge site serving as the mediator, and favorable H2 desorption on Pt site. Benefiting from this catalytic process, the resulting La2Sr2PtO7+δ exhibits a low overpotential of 13 mV at 10 mA cm−2, a small Tafel slope of 22 mV dec−1, an enhanced intrinsic activity, and a greater durability than commercial Pt black catalyst.",Nature Communications
A top-down strategy for amorphization of hydroxyl compounds for electrocatalytic oxygen evolution,"© 2022, The Author(s).Amorphous materials have attracted increasing attention in diverse fields due to their unique properties, yet their controllable fabrications still remain great challenges. Here, we demonstrate a top-down strategy for the fabrications of amorphous oxides through the amorphization of hydroxides. The versatility of this strategy has been validated by the amorphizations of unitary, binary and ternary hydroxides. Detailed characterizations indicate that the amorphization process is realized by the variation of coordination environment during thermal treatment, where the M–OH octahedral structure in hydroxides evolves to M–O tetrahedral structure in amorphous oxides with the disappearance of the M–M coordination. The optimal amorphous oxide (FeCoSn(OH)6-300) exhibits superior oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity in alkaline media, where the turnover frequency (TOF) value is 39.4 times higher than that of FeCoSn(OH)6. Moreover, the enhanced OER performance and the amorphization process are investigated with density functional theory (DFT) and molecule dynamics (MD) simulations. The reported top-down fabrication strategy for fabricating amorphous oxides, may further promote fundamental research into and practical applications of amorphous materials for catalysis.",Nature Communications
Interstitial boron-triggered electron-deficient Os aerogels for enhanced pH-universal hydrogen evolution,"© 2022, The Author(s).Developing high-performance electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is crucial for sustainable hydrogen production, yet still challenging. Here, we report boron-modulated osmium (B-Os) aerogels with rich defects and ultra-fine diameter as a pH-universal HER electrocatalyst. The catalyst shows the small overpotentials of 12, 19, and 33 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm−2 in acidic, alkaline, and neutral electrolytes, respectively, as well as excellent stability, surpassing commercial Pt/C. Operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy shows that interventional interstitial B atoms can optimize the electron structure of B-Os aerogels and stabilize Os as active sites in an electron-deficient state under realistic working conditions, and simultaneously reveals the HER catalytic mechanisms of B-Os aerogels in pH-universal electrolytes. The density functional theory calculations also indicate introducing B atoms can tailor the electronic structure of Os, resulting in the reduced water dissociation energy and the improved adsorption/desorption behavior of hydrogen, which synergistically accelerate HER.",Nature Communications
Splicing the active phases of copper/cobalt-based catalysts achieves high-rate tandem electroreduction of nitrate to ammonia,"© 2022, The Author(s).Electrocatalytic recycling of waste nitrate (NO3−) to valuable ammonia (NH3) at ambient conditions is a green and appealing alternative to the Haber−Bosch process. However, the reaction requires multi-step electron and proton transfer, making it a grand challenge to drive high-rate NH3 synthesis in an energy-efficient way. Herein, we present a design concept of tandem catalysts, which involves coupling intermediate phases of different transition metals, existing at low applied overpotentials, as cooperative active sites that enable cascade NO3−-to-NH3 conversion, in turn avoiding the generally encountered scaling relations. We implement the concept by electrochemical transformation of Cu−Co binary sulfides into potential-dependent core−shell Cu/CuOx and Co/CoO phases. Electrochemical evaluation, kinetic studies, and in−situ Raman spectra reveal that the inner Cu/CuOx phases preferentially catalyze NO3− reduction to NO2−, which is rapidly reduced to NH3 at the nearby Co/CoO shell. This unique tandem catalyst system leads to a NO3−-to-NH3 Faradaic efficiency of 93.3 ± 2.1% in a wide range of NO3− concentrations at pH 13, a high NH3 yield rate of 1.17 mmol cm−2 h−1 in 0.1 M NO3− at −0.175 V vs. RHE, and a half-cell energy efficiency of ~36%, surpassing most previous reports.",Nature Communications

Subnanometric alkaline-earth oxide clusters for sustainable nitrate to ammonia photosynthesis,"© 2022, The Author(s).The limitation of inert N2 molecules with their high dissociation energy has ignited research interests in probing other nitrogen-containing species for ammonia synthesis. Nitrate ions, as an alternative feedstock with high solubility and proton affinity, can be facilely dissociated for sustainable ammonia production. Here we report a nitrate to ammonia photosynthesis route (NO3−RR) catalyzed by subnanometric alkaline-earth oxide clusters. The catalyst exhibits a high ammonia photosynthesis rate of 11.97 mol gmetal−1 h−1 (89.79 mmol gcat−1 h−1) with nearly 100% selectivity. A total ammonia yield of 0.78 mmol within 72 h is achieved, which exhibits a significant advantage in the area of photocatalytic NO3−RR. The investigation of the molecular-level reaction mechanism reveals that the unique active interface between the subnanometric clusters and TiO2 substrate is beneficial for the nitrate activation and dissociation, contributing to efficient and selective nitrate reduction for ammonia production with low energy input. The practical application of NO3−RR route in simulated wastewater is developed, which demonstrates great potential for its industrial application. These findings are of general knowledge for the functional development of clusters-based catalysts and could open up a path in the exploitation of advanced ammonia synthesis routes with low energy consumption and carbon emission.",Nature Communications

Magic of hydrogen spillover: Understanding and application,"© 2022 Institute of Process Engineering, Chinese Academy of SciencesThe hydrogen spillover effect (HSPE) plays an important role in heterogeneous catalysis and hydrogen storage as an interfacial phenomenon, which facilitates the improvement of hydrogen storage properties of porous nanomaterials and indirectly or directly affects the reaction performance of multiphase catalytic reactions. The setting-up of the word “hydrogen spillover” opened up a new area to gain insight into the dynamic behavior of migrating hydrogen atoms on a catalyst surface. However, a comprehensive understanding of the HSPE is still lacking. Today, the development of advanced characterization techniques provides increasingly valuable information to further our understanding of the HSPE. Based on these considerations, in this review, we hope to provide some answers to the question “What is hydrogen spillover and how do we recognize it?”. To do this, we will rely on advanced characterization techniques as well as experimental and theoretical studies. Then, we discuss in detail the influences of the HSPE on hydrogen storage performance and the important catalytic effects of the HSPE in catalysis. These effects will be reviewed by looking through the catalytic results obtained in many reactions in thermal catalysis, electrocatalysis, and photocatalysis. Furthermore, based on the application potential of hydrogen spillover, we present some preliminary research proposals and discuss the opportunities and challenges that remain to be faced in this research area.",Green Energy and Environment

Acid anion electrolyte effects on platinum for oxygen and hydrogen electrocatalysis,"© 2022, The Author(s).Platinum is an important material with applications in oxygen and hydrogen electrocatalysis. To better understand how its activity can be modulated through electrolyte effects in the double layer microenvironment, herein we investigate the effects of different acid anions on platinum for the oxygen reduction/evolution reaction (ORR/OER) and hydrogen evolution/oxidation reaction (HER/HOR) in pH 1 electrolytes. Experimentally, we see the ORR activity trend of HClO4 > HNO3 > H2SO4, and the OER activity trend of HClO4> HNO3 ∼ H2SO4. HER/HOR performance is similar across all three electrolytes. Notably, we demonstrate that ORR performance can be improved 4-fold in nitric acid compared to in sulfuric acid. Assessing the potential-dependent role of relative anion competitive adsorption with density functional theory, we calculate unfavorable adsorption on Pt(111) for all the anions at HER/HOR conditions while under ORR/OER conditions ClO4− binds the weakest followed by NO3− and SO42−. Our combined experimental-theoretical work highlights the importance of understanding the role of anions across a large potential range and reveals nitrate-like electrolyte microenvironments as interesting possible sulfonate alternatives to mitigate the catalyst poisoning effects of polymer membranes/ionomers in electrochemical systems. These findings help inform rational design approaches to further enhance catalyst activity via microenvironment engineering.",Communications Chemistry

Facet-dependent electrooxidation of propylene into propylene oxide over Ag3PO4 crystals,"© 2022, The Author(s).The electrooxidation of propylene into propylene oxide under ambient conditions represents an attractive approach toward propylene oxide. However, this process suffers from a low yield rate over reported electrocatalysts. In this work, we develop an efficient electrocatalyst of Ag3PO4 for the electrooxidation of propylene into propylene oxide. The Ag3PO4 cubes with (100) facets exhibit the highest yield rate of 5.3 gPO m−2 h−1 at 2.4 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode, which is 1.6 and 2.5 times higher than those over Ag3PO4 rhombic dodecahedra with (110) facets and tetrahedra with (111) facets, respectively. The theoretical calculations reveal that the largest polarization of propylene on Ag3PO4 (100) facets is beneficial to break the symmetric π bonding and facilitate the formation of C-O bond. Meanwhile, Ag3PO4(100) facets exhibit the lowest adsorption energies of *C3H6 and *OH, inducing the lowest energy barrier of the rate-determining step and thus accounting for the highest catalytic performance.",Nature Communications
Direct assessment of confinement effect in zeolite-encapsulated subnanometric metal species,"© 2022, The Author(s).Subnanometric metal species confined inside the microporous channels/cavities of zeolites have been demonstrated as stable and efficient catalysts. The confinement interaction between the metal species and zeolite framework has been proposed to play the key role for stabilization, though the confinement interaction is elusive to be identified and measured. By combining theoretical calculations, imaging simulation and experimental measurements based on the scanning transmission electron microscopy-integrated differential phase contrast imaging technique, we have studied the location and coordination environment of isolated iridium atoms and clusters confined in zeolite. The image analysis results indicate that the local strain is intimately related to the strength of metal-zeolite interaction and a good correlation is found between the zeolite deformation energy, the charge state of the iridium species and the local absolute strain. The direct observation of confinement with subnanometric metal species encapsulated in zeolites provides insights to understand their structural features and catalytic consequences.",Nature Communications
A metal-supported single-atom catalytic site enables carbon dioxide hydrogenation,"© 2022, The Author(s).Nitrogen-doped graphene-supported single atoms convert CO2 to CO, but fail to provide further hydrogenation to methane – a finding attributable to the weak adsorption of CO intermediates. To regulate the adsorption energy, here we investigate the metal-supported single atoms to enable CO2 hydrogenation. We find a copper-supported iron-single-atom catalyst producing a high-rate methane. Density functional theory calculations and in-situ Raman spectroscopy show that the iron atoms attract surrounding intermediates and carry out hydrogenation to generate methane. The catalyst is realized by assembling iron phthalocyanine on the copper surface, followed by in-situ formation of single iron atoms during electrocatalysis, identified using operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy. The copper-supported iron-single-atom catalyst exhibits a CO2-to-methane Faradaic efficiency of 64% and a partial current density of 128 mA cm−2, while the nitrogen-doped graphene-supported one produces only CO. The activity is 32 times higher than a pristine copper under the same conditions of electrolyte and bias.",Nature Communications
Unraveling the rate-limiting step of two-electron transfer electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide,"© 2022, The Author(s).Electrochemical reduction of CO2 (CO2ER) has received significant attention due to its potential to sustainably produce valuable fuels and chemicals. However, the reaction mechanism is still not well understood. One vital debate is whether the rate-limiting step (RLS) is dominated by the availability of protons, the conversion of water molecules, or the adsorption of CO2. This paper describes insights into the RLS by investigating pH dependency and kinetic isotope effect with respect to the rate expression of CO2ER. Focusing on electrocatalysts geared towards two-electron transfer reactions, we find the generation rates of CO and formate to be invariant with either pH or deuteration of the electrolyte over Au, Ag, Sn, and In. We elucidate the RLS of two-electron transfer CO2ER to be the adsorption of CO2 onto the surface of electrocatalysts. We expect this finding to provide guidance for improving CO2ER activity through the enhancement of the CO2 adsorption processes by strategies such as surface modification of catalysts as well as careful control of pressure and interfacial electric field within reactors.",Nature Communications
Thermal migration towards constructing W-W dual-sites for boosted alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction,"© 2022, The Author(s).Tungsten carbides, featured by their Pt-like electronic structure, have long been advocated as potential replacements for the benchmark Pt-group catalysts in hydrogen evolution reaction. However, tungsten-carbide catalysts usually exhibit poor alkaline HER performance because of the sluggish hydrogen desorption behavior and possible corrosion problem of tungsten atoms by the produced hydroxyl intermediates. Herein, we report the synthesis of tungsten atomic clusters anchored on P-doped carbon materials via a thermal-migration strategy using tungsten single atoms as the parent material, which is evidenced to have the most favorable Pt-like electronic structure by in-situ variable-temperature near ambient pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements. Accordingly, tungsten atomic clusters show markedly enhanced alkaline HER activity with an ultralow overpotential of 53 mV at 10 mA/cm2 and a Tafel slope as low as 38 mV/dec. These findings may provide a feasible route towards the rational design of atomic-cluster catalysts with high alkaline hydrogen evolution activity.",Nature Communications
Unprecedentedly high activity and selectivity for hydrogenation of nitroarenes with single atomic Co1-N3P1 sites,"© 2022, The Author(s).Transition metal single atom catalysts (SACs) with M1-Nx coordination configuration have shown outstanding activity and selectivity for hydrogenation of nitroarenes. Modulating the atomic coordination structure has emerged as a promising strategy to further improve the catalytic performance. Herein, we report an atomic Co1/NPC catalyst with unsymmetrical single Co1-N3P1 sites that displays unprecedentedly high activity and chemoselectivity for hydrogenation of functionalized nitroarenes. Compared to the most popular Co1-N4 coordination, the electron density of Co atom in Co1-N3P1 is increased, which is more favorable for H2 dissociation as verified by kinetic isotope effect and density functional theory calculation results. In nitrobenzene hydrogenation reaction, the as-synthesized Co1-N3P1 SAC exhibits a turnover frequency of 6560 h−1, which is 60-fold higher than that of Co1-N4 SAC and one order of magnitude higher than the state-of-the-art M1-Nx-C SACs in literatures. Furthermore, Co1-N3P1 SAC shows superior selectivity (>99%) toward many substituted nitroarenes with co-existence of other sensitive reducible groups. This work is an excellent example of relationship between catalytic performance and the coordination environment of SACs, and offers a potential practical catalyst for aromatic amine synthesis by hydrogenation of nitroarenes.",Nature Communications
General heterostructure strategy of photothermal materials for scalable solar-heating hydrogen production without the consumption of artificial energy,"© 2022, The Author(s).Solar-heating catalysis has the potential to realize zero artificial energy consumption, which is restricted by the low ambient solar heating temperatures of photothermal materials. Here, we propose the concept of using heterostructures of black photothermal materials (such as Bi2Te3) and infrared insulating materials (Cu) to elevate solar heating temperatures. Consequently, the heterostructure of Bi2Te3 and Cu (Bi2Te3/Cu) increases the 1 sun-heating temperature of Bi2Te3 from 93 °C to 317 °C by achieving the synergy of 89% solar absorption and 5% infrared radiation. This strategy is applicable for various black photothermal materials to raise the 1 sun-heating temperatures of Ti2O3, Cu2Se, and Cu2S to 295 °C, 271 °C, and 248 °C, respectively. The Bi2Te3/Cu-based device is able to heat CuOx/ZnO/Al2O3 nanosheets to 305 °C under 1 sun irradiation, and this system shows a 1 sun-driven hydrogen production rate of 310 mmol g−1 h−1 from methanol and water, at least 6 times greater than that of all solar-driven systems to date, with 30.1% solar-to-hydrogen efficiency and 20-day operating stability. Furthermore, this system is enlarged to 6 m2 to generate 23.27 m3/day of hydrogen under outdoor sunlight irradiation in the spring, revealing its potential for industrial manufacture.",Nature Communications
Manipulating the oxygen reduction reaction pathway on Pt-coordinated motifs,"© 2022, The Author(s).Electrochemical oxygen reduction could proceed via either 4e−-pathway toward maximum chemical-to-electric energy conversion or 2e−-pathway toward onsite H2O2 production. Bulk Pt catalysts are known as the best monometallic materials catalyzing O2-to-H2O conversion, however, controversies on the reduction product selectivity are noted for atomic dispersed Pt catalysts. Here, we prepare a series of carbon supported Pt single atom catalyst with varied neighboring dopants and Pt site densities to investigate the local coordination environment effect on branching oxygen reduction pathway. Manipulation of 2e− or 4e− reduction pathways is demonstrated through modification of the Pt coordination environment from Pt-C to Pt-N-C and Pt-S-C, giving rise to a controlled H2O2 selectivity from 23.3% to 81.4% and a turnover frequency ratio of H2O2/H2O from 0.30 to 2.67 at 0.4 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode. Energetic analysis suggests both 2e− and 4e− pathways share a common intermediate of *OOH, Pt-C motif favors its dissociative reduction while Pt-S and Pt-N motifs prefer its direct protonation into H2O2. By taking the Pt-N-C catalyst as a stereotype, we further demonstrate that the maximum H2O2 selectivity can be manipulated from 70 to 20% with increasing Pt site density, providing hints for regulating the stepwise oxygen reduction in different application scenarios.",Nature Communications
Ti2N nitride MXene evokes the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism to achieve high selectivity for nitrogen reduction reaction,"© 2022, The Author(s).We address the low selectivity problem faced by the electrochemical nitrogen (N2) reduction reaction (NRR) to ammonia (NH3) by exploiting the Mars-van Krevelen (MvK) mechanism on two-dimensional (2D) Ti2N nitride MXene. NRR technology is a viable alternative to reducing the energy and greenhouse gas emission footprint from NH3 production. Most NRR catalysts operate by using an associative or dissociative mechanism, during which the NRR competes with the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), resulting in low selectivity. The MvK mechanism reduces this competition by eliminating the adsorption and dissociation processes at the sites for NH3 synthesis. We show that the new class of 2D materials, nitride MXenes, evoke the MvK mechanism to achieve the highest Faradaic efficiency (FE) towards NH3 reported for any pristine transition metal-based catalyst—19.85% with a yield of 11.33 μg/cm2/hr at an applied potential of − 250 mV versus RHE. These results can be expanded to a broad class of systems evoking the MvK mechanism and constitute the foundation of NRR technology based on MXenes.",Scientific Reports
Single-atom Cu anchored catalysts for photocatalytic renewable H2 production with a quantum efficiency of 56%,"© 2022, The Author(s).Single-atom catalysts anchoring offers a desirable pathway for efficiency maximization and cost-saving for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. However, the single-atoms loading amount is always within 0.5% in most of the reported due to the agglomeration at higher loading concentrations. In this work, the highly dispersed and large loading amount (>1 wt%) of copper single-atoms were achieved on TiO2, exhibiting the H2 evolution rate of 101.7 mmol g−1 h−1 under simulated solar light irradiation, which is higher than other photocatalysts reported, in addition to the excellent stability as proved after storing 380 days. More importantly, it exhibits an apparent quantum efficiency of 56% at 365 nm, a significant breakthrough in this field. The highly dispersed and large amount of Cu single-atoms incorporation on TiO2 enables the efficient electron transfer via Cu2+-Cu+ process. The present approach paves the way to design advanced materials for remarkable photocatalytic activity and durability.",Nature Communications
Coordination modulation of iridium single-atom catalyst maximizing water oxidation activity,"© 2022, The Author(s).Single-atom catalysts (SACs) have attracted tremendous research interests in various energy-related fields because of their high activity, selectivity and 100% atom utilization. However, it is still a challenge to enhance the intrinsic and specific activity of SACs. Herein, we present an approach to fabricate a high surface distribution density of iridium (Ir) SAC on nickel-iron sulfide nanosheet arrays substrate (Ir1/NFS), which delivers a high water oxidation activity. The Ir1/NFS catalyst offers a low overpotential of ~170 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm−2 and a high turnover frequency of 9.85 s−1 at an overpotential of 300 mV in 1.0 M KOH solution. At the same time, the Ir1/NFS catalyst exhibits a high stability performance, reaching a lifespan up to 350 hours at a current density of 100 mA cm−2. First-principles calculations reveal that the electronic structures of Ir atoms are significantly regulated by the sulfide substrate, endowing an energetically favorable reaction pathway. This work represents a promising strategy to fabricate high surface distribution density single-atom catalysts with high activity and durability for electrochemical water splitting.",Nature Communications
3D atomic-scale imaging of mixed Co-Fe spinel oxide nanoparticles during oxygen evolution reaction,"© 2022, The Author(s).The three-dimensional (3D) distribution of individual atoms on the surface of catalyst nanoparticles plays a vital role in their activity and stability. Optimising the performance of electrocatalysts requires atomic-scale information, but it is difficult to obtain. Here, we use atom probe tomography to elucidate the 3D structure of 10 nm sized Co2FeO4 and CoFe2O4 nanoparticles during oxygen evolution reaction (OER). We reveal nanoscale spinodal decomposition in pristine Co2FeO4. The interfaces of Co-rich and Fe-rich nanodomains of Co2FeO4 become trapping sites for hydroxyl groups, contributing to a higher OER activity compared to that of CoFe2O4. However, the activity of Co2FeO4 drops considerably due to concurrent irreversible transformation towards CoIVO2 and pronounced Fe dissolution. In contrast, there is negligible elemental redistribution for CoFe2O4 after OER, except for surface structural transformation towards (FeIII, CoIII)2O3. Overall, our study provides a unique 3D compositional distribution of mixed Co-Fe spinel oxides, which gives atomic-scale insights into active sites and the deactivation of electrocatalysts during OER.",Nature Communications
Identifying the impact of the covalent-bonded carbon matrix to FeN4 sites for acidic oxygen reduction,"© 2022, The Author(s).The atomic configurations of FeNx moieties are the key to affect the activity of oxygen rection reaction (ORR). However, the traditional synthesis relying on high-temperature pyrolysis towards combining sources of Fe, N, and C often results in the plurality of local environments for the FeNx sites. Unveiling the effect of carbon matrix adjacent to FeNx sites towards ORR activity is important but still is a great challenge due to inevitable connection of diverse N as well as random defects. Here, we report a proof-of-concept study on the evaluation of covalent-bonded carbon environment connected to FeN4 sites on their catalytic activity via pyrolysis-free approach. Basing on the closed π conjugated phthalocyanine-based intrinsic covalent organic polymers (COPs) with well-designed structures, we directly synthesized a series of atomically dispersed Fe-N-C catalysts with various pure carbon environments connected to the same FeN4 sites. Experiments combined with density functional theory demonstrates that the catalytic activities of these COPs materials appear a volcano plot with the increasement of delocalized π electrons in their carbon matrix. The delocalized π electrons changed anti-bonding d-state energy level of the single FeN4 moieties, hence tailored the adsorption between active centers and oxygen intermediates and altered the rate-determining step.",Nature Communications
Interfacial-confined coordination to single-atom nanotherapeutics,"© 2022, The Author(s).Pursuing and developing effective methodologies to construct highly active catalytic sites to maximize the atomic and energy efficiency by material engineering are attractive. Relative to the tremendous researches of carbon-based single atom systems, the construction of bio-applicable single atom materials is still in its infancy. Herein, we propose a facile and general interfacial-confined coordination strategy to construct high-quality single-atom nanotherapeutic agent with Fe single atoms being anchored on defective carbon dots confined in a biocompatible mesoporous silica nanoreactor. Furthermore, the efficient energy conversion capability of silica-based Fe single atoms system has been demonstrated on the basis of the exogenous physical photo irradiation and endogenous biochemical reactive oxygen species stimulus in the confined mesoporous network. More importantly, the highest photothermal conversion efficiency with the mechanism of increased electron density and narrow bandgap of this single atom structure in defective carbon was proposed by the theoretical DFT calculations. The present methodology provides a scientific paradigm to design and develop versatile single atom nanotherapeutics with adjustable metal components and tune the corresponding reactions for safe and efficient tumor therapeutic strategy.",Nature Communications
Single-dispersed polyoxometalate clusters embedded on multilayer graphene as a bifunctional electrocatalyst for efficient Li-S batteries,"© 2022, The Author(s).The redox reactions occurring in the Li-S battery positive electrode conceal various and critical electrocatalytic processes, which strongly influence the performances of this electrochemical energy storage system. Here, we report the development of a single-dispersed molecular cluster catalyst composite comprising of a polyoxometalate framework ([Co4(PW9O34)2]10−) and multilayer reduced graphene oxide. Due to the interfacial charge transfer and exposure of unsaturated cobalt sites, the composite demonstrates efficient polysulfides adsorption and reduced activation energy for polysulfides conversion, thus serving as a bifunctional electrocatalyst. When tested in full Li-S coin cell configuration, the composite allows for a long-term Li-S battery cycling with a capacity fading of 0.015% per cycle after 1000 cycles at 2 C (i.e., 3.36 A g−1). An areal capacity of 4.55 mAh cm−2 is also achieved with a sulfur loading of 5.6 mg cm−2 and E/S ratio of 4.5 μL mg−1. Moreover, Li-S single-electrode pouch cells tested with the bifunctional electrocatalyst demonstrate a specific capacity of about 800 mAh g−1 at a sulfur loading of 3.6 mg cm−2 for 100 cycles at 0.2 C (i.e., 336 mA g−1) with E/S ratio of 5 μL mg−1.",Nature Communications
Alcohols electrooxidation coupled with H2 production at high current densities promoted by a cooperative catalyst,"© 2022, The Author(s).Electrochemical alcohols oxidation offers a promising approach to produce valuable chemicals and facilitate coupled H2 production. However, the corresponding current density is very low at moderate cell potential that substantially limits the overall productivity. Here we report the electrooxidation of benzyl alcohol coupled with H2 production at high current density (540 mA cm−2 at 1.5 V vs. RHE) over a cooperative catalyst of Au nanoparticles supported on cobalt oxyhydroxide nanosheets (Au/CoOOH). The absolute current can further reach 4.8 A at 2.0 V in a more realistic two-electrode membrane-free flow electrolyzer. Experimental combined with theoretical results indicate that the benzyl alcohol can be enriched at Au/CoOOH interface and oxidized by the electrophilic oxygen species (OH*) generated on CoOOH, leading to higher activity than pure Au. Based on the finding that the catalyst can be reversibly oxidized/reduced at anodic potential/open circuit, we design an intermittent potential (IP) strategy for long-term alcohol electrooxidation that achieves high current density (>250 mA cm−2) over 24 h with promoted productivity and decreased energy consumption.",Nature Communications
Interactions between atomically dispersed copper and phosphorous species are key for the hydrochlorination of acetylene,"© 2022, The Author(s).Vinyl chloride, the monomer of polyvinyl chloride (PVC), is industrially synthesized via acetylene hydrochlorination. Thereby, easy to sublimate but toxic mercury chloride catalysts are widely used. It is imperative to find environmentally friendly non-mercury catalysts to promote the green production of PVC. Low-cost copper-based catalysts are promising candidates. In this study, phosphorus-doped Cu-based catalysts are prepared. It is shown that the type of phosphorus configuration and the distribution on the surface of the carrier can be adjusted by changing the calcination temperature. Among the different phosphorus species, the formed P-C bond plays a key role. The coordination structure formed by the interaction between P-C bonds and atomically dispersed Cu2+ species results in effective and stable active sites. Insights on how P-C bonds activate the substrate may provide ideas for the design and optimization of phosphorus-doped catalysts for acetylene hydrochlorination.",Communications Chemistry

Abstract: Hydrogen with high energy density and zero carbon emission is widely acknowledged as the most promising candidate toward world's carbon neutrality and future sustainable eco-society. Water-splitting is a constructive technology for unpolluted and high-purity H2 production, and a series of non-precious electrocatalysts have been developed over the past decade. To further improve the catalytic activities, metal doping is always adopted to modulate the 3d-electronic configuration and electron-donating/accepting (e-DA) properties, while for anion doping, the electronegativity variations among different non-metal elements would also bring some potential in the modulations of e-DA and metal valence for tuning the performances. In this review, we summarize the recent developments of the many different anion-mixed transition metal compounds (e.g., nitrides, halides, phosphides, chalcogenides, oxyhydroxides, and borides/borates) for efficient water electrolysis applications. First, we have introduced the general information of water-splitting and the description of anion-mixed electrocatalysts and highlighted their complementary functions of mixed anions. Furthermore, some latest advances of anion-mixed compounds are also categorized for hydrogen and oxygen evolution electrocatalysis. The rationales behind their enhanced electrochemical performances are discussed. Last but not least, the challenges and future perspectives are briefly proposed for the anion-mixed water dissociation catalysts. [Figure not available: see fulltext.]",Nano-Micro Letters
High-Index Faceted Nanocrystals as Highly Efficient Bifunctional Electrocatalysts for High-Performance Lithium–Sulfur Batteries,"© 2021, The Author(s).Precisely regulating of the surface structure of crystalline materials to improve their catalytic activity for lithium polysulfides is urgently needed for high-performance lithium–sulfur (Li–S) batteries. Herein, high-index faceted iron oxide (Fe2O3) nanocrystals anchored on reduced graphene oxide are developed as highly efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts, effectively improving the electrochemical performance of Li–S batteries. The theoretical and experimental results all indicate that high-index Fe2O3 crystal facets with abundant unsaturated coordinated Fe sites not only have strong adsorption capacity to anchor polysulfides but also have high catalytic activity to facilitate the redox transformation of polysulfides and reduce the decomposition energy barrier of Li2S. The Li–S batteries with these bifunctional electrocatalysts exhibit high initial capacity of 1521 mAh g−1 at 0.1 C and excellent cycling performance with a low capacity fading of 0.025% per cycle during 1600 cycles at 2 C. Even with a high sulfur loading of 9.41 mg cm−2, a remarkable areal capacity of 7.61 mAh cm−2 was maintained after 85 cycles. This work provides a new strategy to improve the catalytic activity of nanocrystals through the crystal facet engineering, deepening the comprehending of facet-dependent activity of catalysts in Li–S chemistry, affording a novel perspective for the design of advanced sulfur electrodes.[Figure not available: see fulltext.]",Nano-Micro Letters

Herein, we introduce boron (B) atoms to modify the local electronic structure of bismuth with positive valence sites for boosting conversion of CO2 into formate with high activity and selectivity in a wide potential window. By combining experimental and computational investigations, our study indicates that B dopant differentiates the proton participations of rate-determining steps in CO2 reduction and in the competing hydrogen evolution. By comparing the experimental observations with the density functional theory, the dominant mechanistic pathway of B promoted formate generation and the B concentration modulated effects on the catalytic property of Bi are unravelled. This comprehensive study offers deep mechanistic insights into the reaction pathway at an atomic and molecular level and provides an effective strategy for the rational design of highly active and selective electrocatalysts for efficient CO2 conversion.

Identification of the Intrinsic Dielectric Properties of Metal Single Atoms for Electromagnetic Wave Absorption,"© 2021, The Author(s).Atomically dispersed metals on N-doped carbon supports (M–N xCs) have great potential applications in various fields. However, a precise understanding of the definitive relationship between the configuration of metal single atoms and the dielectric loss properties of M–N xCs at the atomic-level is still lacking. Herein, we report a general approach to synthesize a series of three-dimensional (3D) honeycomb-like M–NxC (M = Mn, Fe, Co, Cu, or Ni) containing metal single atoms. Experimental results indicate that 3D M–N xCs exhibit a greatly enhanced dielectric loss compared with that of the NC matrix. Theoretical calculations demonstrate that the density of states of the d orbitals near the Fermi level is significantly increased and additional electrical dipoles are induced due to the destruction of the symmetry of the local microstructure, which enhances conductive loss and dipolar polarization loss of 3D M–N xCs, respectively. Consequently, these 3D M–N xCs exhibit excellent electromagnetic wave absorption properties, outperforming the most commonly reported absorbers. This study systematically explains the mechanism of dielectric loss at the atomic level for the first time and is of significance to the rational design of high-efficiency electromagnetic wave absorbing materials containing metal single atoms.[Figure not available: see fulltext.]",Nano-Micro Letters
Three-Phase Heterojunction NiMo-Based Nano-Needle for Water Splitting at Industrial Alkaline Condition,"© 2021, The Author(s).Constructing heterojunction is an effective strategy to develop high-performance non-precious-metal-based catalysts for electrochemical water splitting (WS). Herein, we design and prepare an N-doped-carbon-encapsulated Ni/MoO2 nano-needle with three-phase heterojunction (Ni/MoO2@CN) for accelerating the WS under industrial alkaline condition. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the electrons are redistributed at the three-phase heterojunction interface, which optimizes the adsorption energy of H- and O-containing intermediates to obtain the best ΔG H* for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and decrease the ΔG value of rate-determining step for oxygen evolution reaction (OER), thus enhancing the HER/OER catalytic activity. Electrochemical results confirm that Ni/MoO2@CN exhibits good activity for HER (ƞ-10 = 33 mV, ƞ-1000 = 267 mV) and OER (ƞ 10 = 250 mV, ƞ 1000 = 420 mV). It shows a low potential of 1.86 V at 1000 mA cm−2 for WS in 6.0 M KOH solution at 60 °C and can steadily operate for 330 h. This good HER/OER performance can be attributed to the three-phase heterojunction with high intrinsic activity and the self-supporting nano-needle with more active sites, faster mass diffusion, and bubbles release. This work provides a unique idea for designing high efficiency catalytic materials for WS.[Figure not available: see fulltext.]",Nano-Micro Letters
Atomically Dispersed Fe-Co Bimetallic Catalysts for the Promoted Electroreduction of Carbon Dioxide,"© 2021, The Author(s).The electroreduction reaction of CO2 (ECO2RR) requires high-performance catalysts to convert CO2 into useful chemicals. Transition metal-based atomically dispersed catalysts are promising for the high selectivity and activity in ECO2RR. This work presents a series of atomically dispersed Co, Fe bimetallic catalysts by carbonizing the Fe-introduced Co-zeolitic-imidazolate-framework (C–Fe–Co–ZIF) for the syngas generation from ECO2RR. The synergistic effect of the bimetallic catalyst promotes CO production. Compared to the pure C–Co–ZIF, C–Fe–Co–ZIF facilitates CO production with a CO Faradaic efficiency (FE) boost of 10%, with optimal FECO of 51.9%, FEH2 of 42.4% at − 0.55 V, and CO current density of 8.0 mA cm−2 at − 0.7 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). The H2/CO ratio is tunable from 0.8 to 4.2 in a wide potential window of − 0.35 to − 0.8 V versus RHE. The total FECO+H2 maintains as high as 93% over 10 h. The proper adding amount of Fe could increase the number of active sites and create mild distortions for the nanoscopic environments of Co and Fe, which is essential for the enhancement of the CO production in ECO2RR. The positive impacts of Cu–Co and Ni–Co bimetallic catalysts demonstrate the versatility and potential application of the bimetallic strategy for ECO2RR.[Figure not available: see fulltext.].",Nano-Micro Letters

The doped graphitic N is found to be the active site and hydroxyl ion participating in the oxidation of D-xylose. Hydroxyl ion and D-xylose first adsorb on NC-800-5 surface, and the aldehyde group of D-xylose is catalyzed to form germinal diols ion. Then, C–H bond break to yield carboxylic group.

Deep eutectic solvent strategy enables an octahedral Ni–Co precursor for creating high-performance NiCo2O4 catalyst toward oxygen evolution reaction,"© 2021 Institute of Process Engineering, Chinese Academy of SciencesDeep eutectic solvents (DESs) have gained much attention in the fabrication of advanced nanoelectrocatalysts due to their amazing template function. However, their stabilizing function for easily hydrolyzed inorganic nanomaterials is rarely studied. Here, a DES-mediated strategy was reported to synthesize octahedral Ni–Co precursor (NiCo–NH3 complex), which could be directly transformed into NiCo2O4 nanooctahedrons after thermal decomposition. The NiCo–NH3 precursor in octahedral shape was achieved with the DES-mediated crystallization in the choline chloride (ChCl)/glycerol. The ChCl/glycerol DES not only tailored the morphology of the as-prepared precursor by template effect but also inhibited its hydrolysis, ensuring the successful fabrication of octahedral NiCo–NH3 complex precursor with high yield. The NiCo–NH3 complex precursor was converted to well-defined NiCo2O4 nanooctahedrons, where the calcination temperature and time were explored in detail. It revealed that DES could participate in the conversion process to control the morphology of calcination product. The resultant NiCo2O4 nanooctahedrons demonstrated excellent electroactivity and remarkable durability for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The present strategy not only offers an efficient OER electrocatalyst but also enriches the approaches of DESs in designing advanced nanocatalysts.",Green Energy and Environment

A series of Ru/g-C3N4-H2 catalysts with Ru species supported on the nanosheet g-C3N4-H2 were synthesized via ultrasonic assisted impregnation-deposition method. Ultrafine Ru nanoparticles (<2 nm) were highly dispersed on nanosheet g-C3N4-H2. Strong interaction due to Ru-Nx coordination facilitated the uniform distribution of Ru species. Meanwhile, the involvement of surface basicity derived from abundant nitrogen sites was favourable for enhancing the selective hydrogenation performance of bi-benzene ring, i.e., almost complete 4,4′-diaminodiphenylmethane (MDA) conversion and >99% 4,4′-diaminodicyclohexylmethane selectivity, corresponding to a reaction activity of 35.7 molMDA molRu−1 h−1. Moreover, the reaction activity of catalyst in the fifth run was 36.5 molMDA molRu−1 h−1, which was comparable with that of the fresh one. The computational results showed that g-C3N4 as support was favorable for adsorption and dissociation of H2 molecules. Moreover, the substrate scope can be successfully expanded to a variety of other aromatic diamines. Therefore, this work provides an efficient and green catalyst system for selective hydrogenation of aromatic diamines.",Green Energy and Environment
Etching-directed nitrogen doping strategy to construct efficient defective sites in carbon for electrocatalytic oxygen reduction,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Construction of synergistic coupling sites of intrinsic carbon defects and N dopants in N-doped carbon is of great significance to improve the catalytic activities of metal-free carbon-based materials toward oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). However, the carbon-defect construction and N doping by existing strategies are usually independent processes, resulting in a random arrangement of the intrinsic carbon defects and N-dopants (i.e., hardly forming the coupling sites) in the resultant carbon materials. Herein, an etching-directed nitrogen doping strategy for constructing carbon defect/N dopant coupling sites is developed, in which nitrogen is directionally doped at the freshly created intrinsic carbon defects during the synthesis of N-doped carbon. The as-prepared N-doped carbon catalyst enriched with such coupling sites renders a remarkable ORR catalytic activity with an ORR half-wave potential of 0.891 V vs. RHE and an excellent long-term durability (3% current loss after 15,000 s at 0.6 V vs. RHE). Experimental characterizations and theoretical calculations reveal the formation mechanism of the coupling sites as well as the origin of their high catalytic activities toward ORR. This etching-directed nitrogen doping strategy shows great universality for the controllable construction of active sites in carbon-based materials derived from different precursors for electrochemical energy storage and conversion applications.",Journal of Power Sources
Bi2O3 particles embedded in carbon matrix as high-performance anode materials for potassium ion batteries,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Potassium-ion batteries (PIBs) are expected to replace lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) as the next generation of electrochemical energy storage products. However, due to the large radius of potassium ion, the anode material undergoes drastic volume expansion during the battery cycle, resulting in performance degradation. Bi2O3 is a kind of material with high theoretical specific capacity, but there is seldom research in potassium-ion batteries. Herein, we design a Bi2O3 nanomaterial embedded in a carbon matrix. The introduction of carbon matrix can not only improve the electronic conductivity of the material, but also alleviate the volume expansion of bismuth oxide. After 100 cycles of 50 mA g−1, its specific charging capacity is 314 mA h g−1, which shows good cycle stability. By ex situ X-ray diffraction, cyclic voltammetry and charge-discharge curves, it is confirmed that the mechanism of potassium ion storage on Bi2O3@C electrode is the combination of transformation reaction mechanism and alloying reaction mechanism.",Journal of Power Sources
Novel ternary CuO–ZnO–MoS2 composite material for electrochemical CO2 reduction to alcohols,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Electrochemical reduction of CO2 with high selectivity for alcohol production has been considered as a proper way to address both energy catastrophe and environmental complications around the globe. Herein, two metal oxides, namely CuO and ZnO having great potential to catalyze the CO2 reduction, are chosen to form a composite with MoS2, where MoS2 sheets act as support and enhance electrocatalytic properties of CuO–ZnO due to their synergistic effect. The synthesis and characterizations of the tricomponent CuO–ZnO–MoS2 composite material is reported for the first time in this work. The composite possessed outstanding catalytic performance in CO2 reduction to alcohol in terms of extraordinary current density (121 mA/cm2) and low onset potential (−0.23 V vs RHE). The composite material showed maximum faradaic efficiency of 24.6% and 11.1% for methanol and ethanol at −0.6 V and −0.9 V vs RHE, respectively.",Journal of Power Sources
Synthesis of nitrogen-doped polyaniline-derived carbon/Ni3Fe nanocomposites as high-performance microwave absorbers,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Polyaniline-derived carbon (PDC) and Ni3Fe composites for electromagnetic wave (EMW) absorption were prepared through in-situ polymerization and carbonization. Using polyaniline as carbon source not only realized the doping of carbon with nitrogen, but also allowed homogeneous dispersion of Ni3Fe nanoparticles to achieve multiple reflection interfaces. The content of Ni3Fe can be used to control the impedance matching of the composites, while the dual loss mechanism of dielectric loss and magnetic loss was realized to promote EMW absorption performance. The polyaniline-derived carbon/Ni3Fe (PDC/Ni3Fe) nanocomposite with optimized composition had a minimum reflection loss (RL) of − 80.91 dB. A maximum effective bandwidth of 6.10 GHz (11.90 −18.00 GHz) was achieved, while the thickness is 2.12 mm.",Journal of Alloys and Compounds
Validation of synergistic effect in N–C@SnO2 hollow nano-microspheres through interfacial chemical bonding for boosting electrochemical sensing,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Higher resistance is exceptionally detrimental to metal oxide-based electrochemical sensors' detection performances that depend on their electrical conductivity. Herein, guided by the synergistic effect of the heterophase boundary, a hollow core–shell combination with a double-layered structure was engineered via hydrolysis strategy, namely nitrogen-doped carbon hollow nano-microspheres (N–C HNMs) coated with SnO2 outer layer (N–C@SnO2 HNMs), then applied for high-performance electrochemical sensing. Advantages including large surface area and strong electronic coupling of Sn-C bond on the boundary facilitated the adsorption of target molecules and electron transferring across the composites, achieving efficient quantitative identification. Density functional theory (DFT) calculation demonstrated the motivation of the charge accumulation at the interface due to the formation of the Sn-C bond, which acted as a bridge for charge transfer. Unsurprisingly, the N–C@SnO2 HNMs-based electrode showed an excellent performance toward dopamine (DA), such as favorable DA selectivity, a lower limit of detection, and a wide linear detection range. Moreover, the electrode material could be applied to the microsensor for in-situ DA detection in artificial sweat.",Applied Surface Science
"Bimetallic MMoS4 (M = Ni, Co, Cu) cocatalysts architected CdS nanoflowers for synergistically boosting visible-light-driven photocatalytic H2 evolution from water and benzyl alcohol","© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Exploring efficient photocatalysts to facilitate water splitting into green hydrogen (H2) energy is of great significance nowadays. In this work, we successfully synthesized CdS nanoflowers coated by zero-dimensional MMoS4 (M = Ni, Co, Cu) cocatalysts using a mild two-pot solvothermal method. Notably, 2.5%-NiMoS4/CdS catalyst exhibits optimal photocatalytic H2 evolution from benzyl alcohol aqueous solution under visible-light irradiation, and its photocatalytic H2 activity (7269.5 μmol·h−1·g−1) is 10.1 times higher than that of pure CdS (716.6 μmol·h−1·g−1). Simultaneously, benzyl alcohol can be synergistically converted into benzaldehyde after dehydrogenation. Such excellent photocatalytic performance mainly benefits from the existence of an internal electric field (IEF), which is demonstrated by experimental analysis and density functional theory calculations. And the IEF greatly accelerates the separation of electron-hole pairs during the photocatalytic H2 evolution process.",Journal of Alloys and Compounds
Mechanistic study of low-temperature CO oxidation over CuO/Cu2O interfaces with oxygen vacancy modification,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Copper oxides have attracted great attention in the oxidation of CO due to their high activity at low temperatures. In this work, novel CuO/Cu2O heterojunction catalysts for low-temperature CO oxidation was prepared via hydrothermal in-situ oxidizing in H2O2. Based on studies of surface composition and the corresponding catalytic activities, the CuO/Cu2O catalysts contain rich oxygen vacancies (OVs), which improve the activation and migration ability of O2. The coupling effect between OVs and heterojunction reduces the activation energy of CO oxidation, leading the temperature of CO completed oxidation temperature from 250 °C to 140 °C. In addition, the in-situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (in-situ FTIR) and Density functional theory (DFT) studies confirm two reaction paths under Langmuir-Hinshelwood (LH) mechanism: a low barrier path takes place at low temperature, and another new reaction path with a barrier of 1.8 eV can take place at a high temperature. The new reaction site formed at the CuO/Cu2O interface resulted in different activation modes of CO and O2. The modification of OVs significantly reduces the reaction temperature required. This work provides a method to improve the performance of co-catalytic oxidation via the coupling effect of OVs and heterojunctions.",Applied Surface Science
CdS-based ternary composite material for high-efficiency photocatalytic CO2 reduction via a cascade electron transfer,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.CdS conductor has a suitable band gap (~2.4 eV), and the energy band position is conducive to photocatalytic CO2 reduction. However, its photocatalytic efficiency is highly confined by its unfavored carrier transfer. In this study, a moderately in-situ growth method is harnessed to insert commercial TiO2 particles (P25) into the CdS grains in the first place, and the resulted CdS-P25 composite is further integrated with to a mixed-ligand-based metal organic framework (MOF), CuTCPP⊂UiO-66 (CTU), which is structure-analogous to regular UiO-66 MOF but with visible light response thanks to the involvement of copper(II) tetra(4-carboxyphenyl) porphyrin (CuTCPP) ligand. The eventually attained ternary composite (CTU/CdS-P25) by solvothermal approach presents a broadened light absorption and an impressive delivery for photo-induced carriers. The light-driven catalytic assessment of CTU/CdS-P25 for CO2 reduction furnishes the CO production rate as great as 2.38 μmol·h−1, as much as 3.9 and 8.8 times that of UiO/CdS-P25 and CdS-P25, respectively. According to the value determination of band edge for each component of the ternary composite, we proposed that the established heterojunction facilitates a cascade electron transfer mode within the structure, which highly suppresses the adverse recombination of carriers and thereafter significantly enhances the photocatalytic behavior. Our work provides an effective perspective for the melioration of CdS semiconductor.",Journal of Alloys and Compounds

In the present study, hexagonal close-packed (hcp) ZnCo nanoalloy enclosed in N-doped carbon (hcp-ZnCo@NC) are created using a simple fabrication approach and are characterized via various complementary techniques. The fabricated hcp-ZnCo@NC shows remarkable oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance in alkaline conditions (1 M KOH). The synthesized hcp-ZnCo@NC with Zn/Co ratio of ≈ 1:1 exhibits overpotentials of 282 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm−2 with a smaller tafel slope of 51.9 mV dec−1, and good stability of 30 h. These characteristics of the present material are better when compared with the state of the art. The enhanced efficiency of the hcp-ZnCo@NC is because of its favorable electron transfer characteristics and high conductivity. Hence, this study offers a new perception for future applications due to the unique crystal phase-linked electrical properties.",Journal of Alloys and Compounds
Study on flexible thin air electrodes and electrochemical performance of LR6 size as well as pouch Zn-air cells,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Manufacturing stable and thin air electrodes for flexible Zn-air batteries becomes increasingly important and remains challenge. Here, we report low-cost mechanical calendering to fabricate thin gas-diffusion layers (GDL), catalytic layers (CL) and then heat pressing together. Finally, cylindrical and other sizes of flexible air electrodes are produced without the use of commercially expensive carbon cloth or carbon papers. By assembling the flexible air cathodes with anode Zn-In-Bi alloy powders or Zn foils, alkaline gel electrolytes and membranes, two kinds of Zn-air cells are assembled for performance evaluation. Results reveal that the LR6 Zn-air cells show a capacity of 5300–5400 mAh and an energy density of 340 Wh·kg−1 at 100 mA, having a double discharge capacity compared to the same size alkaline ZnMnO2 cells. Under a high drain rate of 1000 mA, the capacity and utilization of the Zn alloy powder remain 2750 mAh and 372 mAh·g−1, respectively. The flexible pouch Zn-air cells exhibit excellent charge-discharge performance under conditions of each cycle with 10 min at 2 mA cm−2. The discharge voltage is maintained in the range of 1.25–1.30 V within 120 cycles while the charge voltage is 2.00–2.05 V. These results demonstrate that the thin air cathodes can satisfy the high bending requirements for cylindrical LR6 size cells and flexible pouch Zn-air cells, as well as have high mechanical stability and electrochemical performance. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopies of the air cathodes and Zn-air cells are also examined.",Journal of Alloys and Compounds
Surface/interface engineering for fabricating hierarchical Ir doped NiMoO4 covered by CoMn layered double hydroxide toward oxygen evolution reaction,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Designing and fabricating outstanding electrocatalysts for anodic oxygen evolution reaction plays a key role in driving the earlier application of water splitting for large-scale hydrogen production. Surface/interface engineering is regarded as the most effective method for activating the active sites and modulating the electronic structure, which are two crucial factors determining the electrocatalytic performance. Herein, amorphous CoMn LDH ultrathin nanosheets doped by Ir are integrated with low-crystalline NiMoO4 nanorods (Ir-NiMoO4/Ir-CoMn LDH) to fabricate advanced hierarchical OER electrocatalysts. The optimized Ir-NiMoO4/Ir-Co3Mn2 LDH exhibits excellent OER performance as attested by an ultralow overpotential of 221 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm−2, as well as superb long-term durability. The intimate interface between NiMoO4 and Co LDH and modified electronic structure induced by Ir and Mn doping can greatly optimize the binding strength of between active sites and intermediated species, which improves the electrocatalytic OER performance. This study manifests how the synergistic surface/interface engineering design of nanomaterials boosts their catalytic activity.",Journal of Alloys and Compounds
Manganese decoration tailored nitrogen doping for boosted oxygen reduction electrocatalysis of Co-NC,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Increasing the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) electrocatalytic performance of cobalt-nitrogen carbon (Co-NC) materials is highly desired for promoting their widespread application. Yet, it remains challenging due to the existence of activity gap between Co-NC and commercial Pt/C catalyst. Herein, an in-situ decoration strategy was proposed to construct a series of manganese tailored Co-NC (CoxMn-NC, where x represents the molar ratio of Co/Mn) electrocatalysts, which not only increased the content of active metal-Nx sites but also enhanced the graphitized degree of carbon skeleton. The optimal Co0.2Mn-NC exhibited higher half-wave potentials (0.868 V; 0.594 V) than Pt/C (0.838 V; 0.580 V) and robust catalytic stability in alkaline and neutral electrolytes, which was attributed to the tailored nitrogen doping and enhanced graphitized degree. Impressively, a magnesium-air battery driven by Co0.2Mn-NC exhibited better discharging performance than one driven by Pt/C, with a high open circuit voltage (1.61 V), a large peak power density of 83.17 mW cm−2, and a long discharge time of> 87 h at 20 mA cm−2. This work highlighted the promising potential of Mn decorated Co-NC for ORR related energy conversion.",Journal of Alloys and Compounds
Structural regulation of molybdenum carbide/nitride electrocatalyst for enhanced hydrogen evolution in acidic and alkaline media,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Herein, the ultrafine molybdenum carbide/nitride (Mo2C/Mo2N) heterojunction loaded by nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P)-codoped carbon matrix with hierarchical porous (PNC) is prepared in-situ by fabricating the ternary complex of silica (SiO2) nanoparticles, chitosan (CS) and phosphomolybdic acid (PMo12) as precursor, followed by annealing and hydrofluoric acid (HF) etching. Due to the excellent structural characteristics of the optimized catalyst Mo2C/Mo2N@PNC-8-2, including the Mo2C/Mo2N heterojunction and its uniform dispersion in PNC, P-doping in Mo2C/Mo2N, Mo vacancies, the strong interface coupling between Mo2C/Mo2N heterojunctions and PNC, as well as the connected macroporous channels and hierarchical porous structure, etc., not only large numbers of active sites are exposed, but also the electron density distribution around Mo atoms is tuned. Therefore, the charge/mass transport is greatly improved, resulting in the more superior hydrogen evolution activity of Mo2C/Mo2N@PNC-8-2 than that of the single-phased Mo2C or Mo2N counterpart, with lower overpotentials of 62 or 97 mV to achieve10 mA cm−2 in alkaline or acidic solution, respectively. Moreover, Mo2C/Mo2N@PNC-8-2 still shows excellent long-term durability. This study opens up a new idea for designing highly efficient electrocatalysts via integrating heterojunction, defects, heteroatom doping, and hierarchical porous structure.",Journal of Alloys and Compounds
Bimetal-anchored covalent organic frameworks derivatives for efficient alkaline electrolyte oxygen evolution,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Developing non-precious metal electrocatalysts with stable and high activity toward the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is of great significance for efficient electrolysis of water for hydrogen production. Herein, we report an electrocatalyst derived from covalent organic frameworks (COFs) anchored by pyrolytically active bimetals (Fe/Co), in which COF-derived carbon is used as the support to anchor active bimetal Fe/Co nanoparticles. The porous and periodically structured COFs have great potential as active center carriers for electrocatalysts. Since Fe/Co ions are immobilized in the pore channels of the triazine-based Schiff base network (SNW-1), the aggregation and migration of Fe/Co ions effectively was prevented during pyrolysis. Importantly, the COF-derived catalyst possesses abundant nitrogen content, high micropore and mesopore volumes and good electrolyte permeability. As a result, the COF-derived catalyst displays excellent OER performance, with low overpotential (η10 = 288 mV) and Tafel slope (40 mV dec−1) in alkaline media, outperforming commercial RuO2 and most oxygen electrocatalysts. Moreover, the catalyst exhibited satisfactory stability. Thus, this work expands new horizons and pathways for the development of OER electrocatalysts based on COFs.",Journal of Alloys and Compounds

Controllable construction of boron and nitrogen co-doping honeycomb porous carbon as promising materials for CO2 capture and supercapacitors,"© 2022Multifunctional porous carbon materials are regarded as prospective candidates to sustainable working environment and energy storage devices due to their excellent renewable and recycled properties. Herein, we developed a scannable strategy to prepare a boron and nitrogen co-doping honeycomb porous carbon materials (BNHCs) with high specific surface area applied for CO2 capture and supercapacitors, displaying an outstanding CO2 capture ability of 5.38 mmol g−1 at 273 K under atmospheric pressure and great specific capacitance 389.4F g−1 at 0.2 A g−1 with superior capacitance retention of 98.2 % initial capacity after 10,000 cycles. The adsorption energy, differential charge densities and density of states were calculated by density functional theory (DFT) to further evaluate the mechanism of the effect of B/N co-doping carbon on the performance of supercapacitors, which theoretically verified that the incorporation of B/N atoms has a positive effect on the charge transfer. Moreover, the BNHC-650//NiCo2S4/NF asymmetric supercapacitor exhibits an energy density of 45.8 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 800 W kg−1. The novel synthetical route offers an effective strategy to simultaneously improve CO2 capture and energy storage.",Journal of Energy Storage
Elucidating the effect of Ce/Zr ratio on high temperature shift activity with sulfur poisoning,"© 2022 The Korean Society of Industrial and Engineering ChemistryTo elucidate the effect of CeO2/ZrO2 ratio on the sulfur-tolerance in high temperature shift using waste derived synthesis gas, the Ce/Zr ratio in Pt/CexZr1-xO2 catalysts was systematically changed. Pt/CexZr1-xO2 catalysts were applied to the high temperature shift reaction with 500 ppm H2S. In the presence of H2S, the catalysts were deactivated with time on stream due to the poisioning of H2S. Sulfur-tolerance in high temperature shift activity depended upon the oxygen storage capacity of the catalysts. The regeneration rate of the catalysts was also related with the oxygen storage capacity. In addition, the Pt dispersion matched the oxygen storage capacity trend. The oxygen storage capacity is a main function to determine the sulfur tolerance in high temperature shift activity compared to the dispersion of Pt.",Journal of Industrial and Engineering Chemistry
Advanced separator containing metallic cobalt-molybdenum carbide@ 3D porous carbon for lithium-sulfur batteries,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries have many good prospects for electrochemical energy storage, but they still face some important challenges, such as lithium polysulfide shuttles, which leads to irreversible loss of active materials. In this work, for the first time, metallic cobalt-molybdenum carbide wrapped within 3D porous carbon, served as a functional layer (MoCo@CHS3) on the separator of high-performance Li-S batteries. The MoCo@CHS3 obtained through the sol-gel method composite renders superior cycling performance and structural stability. Electrochemical performance confirms that the 3D porous framework with large specific surface area and pore volume can reuse the sulfur, improve conductivity, and effectively suppress the shuttling problem on account of the polysulfide capture capability. Additionally, the MoCo@CHS3 electrocatalyst provides multiple adsorption sites to capture polysulfides and promote redox reactions of polysulfides, which limit the shuttle of polysulfides. Consequently, the Li-S battery with MoCo@CHS3-PP coated separator shows an excellent capacity of 1026.7 mAh g−1 at 1 C (sulfur load, 1.9–2.2 mg cm−2), and excellent cycle stability (after 600 cycles, the capacity decay rate was only 0.066%). A high discharge specific capacity of 1022.4 mAh g−1 at 0.2 C is obtained after activation and it remains at 780.7 mAh g−1 after 200 cycles when the sulfur load is 5.0 mg cm−2. The separators modified by MoCo@CHS3 have excellent application prospects in Li-S batteries.",Journal of Alloys and Compounds
Facile synthesis of the direct Z-scheme sulfuretted NiFe-layered double hydroxides/CdS heterojunction for the improved photodegradation of model organic pollutants,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Exploiting efficient and reusable photocatalysts is a challenging matter for environmental pollutants remediation. Herein, the novel sulfuretted NiFe-layered double hydroxides/CdS (NiFeSx/CdS) Z-scheme photocatalysts were rationally fabricated by in-situ solvothermal methods and the various characterization techniques, such as XRD, FT-IR, TEM, HR-TEM, XPS and UV-Vis DRS, demonstrated that the photocatalysts were successfully synthesized. Moreover, the NiFeSx/CdS100 heterostructure exhibited the optimal tetracycline hydrochloride (TC) removal efficiency of 85.77%, which was 3.10 and 2.42 times higher than the NiFeSx and CdS, respectively. In addition, the photodegradation performances of NiFeSx/CdS100 composites towards MB and RhB also reached up to 92.09% and 92.81%, respectively. The exceptional photodegradation activity was ascribed to the higher visible light utilization as well as the fast photo-induced electrons and holes separation efficiency. More importantly, the good configurational stability and recyclability of NiFeSx/CdS were observed because of its strong synergistic effect, which provides the possibility of photocatalytic degradation of environmental pollutants for a long time. At last, based on the consideration of band position and supervising of active radicals, the legitimate Z-scheme photocatalytic mechanism was proposed. The current work supplies novel insights for exploitation of sustainable solar energy in environmental remediation.",Journal of Alloys and Compounds
Gd-Co nanosheet arrays coated on N-doped carbon spheres as cathode catalyst in photosynthetic microalgae microbial fuel cells,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Biocompatible, durable and high catalytic cathode is crucial for the performance of photosynthetic microalgae microbial fuel cell (PMMFC). In this study, gadolinium-cobalt (Gd-Co) nanosheet arrays were coated on N-doped carbon spheres (N-CSs) that were supported using nickel foam (NF), to form a unique 3D hierarchical architecture of Gd-Co@N-CSs/NF cathode material. The morphology and structure of Gd-Co@N-CSs/NF was investigated by physicochemical characterization. The electricity generation and stability of NF, N-CSs/NF, Co@N-CSs/NF and Gd-Co@N-CSs/NF were evaluated using a dual-chamber PMMFC system with Chlorella vulgaris (C. vulgaris) in the cathode chamber. Results showed that doption of Gd to the cathode material resulted in Gd-Co@N-CSs/NF exhibiting superior catalytic activity for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), with an ORR peak potential of 0.78 V (vs. RHE). The electron transfer number (n) of Gd-Co@N-CSs/NF was 3.906, indicating ORR was mainly realized via 4e− transfer pathway. Gd-Co@N-CSs/NF achieved a maximum power density of 115.9 mW m−2 and an open circuit voltage of 614.8 mV, higher than the other three cathode materials. Gd-Co@N-CSs/NF exhibited excellent stability during 360 h of the PMMFC process, only dropping 5.8 % of maximum voltage. The cell density of C. vulgaris (3.7 × 1010 cells L−1) in Gd-Co@N-CSs/NF system was significantly higher than those of NF, N-CSs/NF and Co@N-CSs/NF. This study shows that Gd-Co@N-CSs/NF is a promising cathode material and may be highly beneficial for the enhancement of PMMFC systems.",Science of the Total Environment
Carboxylate-assisted ZIF-derived Co nanoclusters anchoring hierarchically porous carbon as high-efficient zinc-air batteries cathode catalysts,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Metal and nitrogen-doped carbon (M-N-C) catalysts are generally considered to be ideal substitutes for platinum-based noble metal oxygen reduction catalysts. Owing to the significant Fenton effect of the Fe element and the subsequent instability, the Fenton-free Co-based N–C catalyst should perform better in ORR. Pyrolysis of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) is commonly used to make Co-based N–C catalysts. Still, most of the MOF-derived catalysts reported so far have a microporous structure, which results in hindered mass transfer and partial Co-Nx active sites that cannot function as catalysis. Herein, Co nanoclusters (NCs) with high loading (7.96 wt%) were prepared on hierarchically porous carbon substrates via a carboxylate-assisted strategy. The mesoporous structure of Co nanoclusters/nitrogen-doped hierarchically porous carbon (Co NCs/HPNC) can facilitate mass transport. The smaller size Co nanoclusters can increase the contact area between the carbon matrix and Co-Nx active sites to effectively expose more active centers and increase the density of Co-Nx active sites. A synergistic effect of the two can greatly improve ORR results. Surprisingly, the Co NCs/HPNC catalyst shows excellent ORR activity under alkaline conditions, and Co NCs/HPNC has a better half-wave potential (0.88 V vs. 0.84 V) compared with 20 wt% Pt/C. And it only loses 5% of its current density after 36,000 s of operation, which is significantly less than Pt/C (20%). Furthermore, Co NCs/HPNC battery have a greater open-circuit potential, power density, and specific capacity than Pt/C-based zinc-air batteries (1.51 V, 109.6 mW cm−2, 818.1 mAh gZn−1 vs. 1.46 V, 92.4 mW cm−2, 716.8 mAh gZn−1). This discovery paves the way for high-efficiency electrocatalysts with hierarchically porous architectures and a large number of metal loads to be developed.",Journal of Alloys and Compounds
Microwave-assisted hydrothermal synthesis of 2D/2D MoS2/Ti3C2Tx heterostructure for enhanced microwave absorbing performance,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Simple and effective synthesis methods for 2D/2D heterostructure and the synergistic effect of 2D/2D composites on microwave absorbing (MWA) performance remain to be further explored and investigated. Herein, 2D/2D MoS2/Ti3C2Tx heterostructure was successfully synthesized in 30 min by a cost-effective and time-saving microwave-assisted hydrothermal method. The 2 H-MoS2 nanosheets with a thickness of 5–10 nm were homogeneously anchored on the surface of Ti3C2Tx layers, showing a tunable distribution density. Besides, the metallic properties of MoS2/Ti3C2Tx and the strong interaction between MoS2 and Ti3C2Tx, were revealed by DFT calculations, which was employed to further understand the MWA mechanism in terms of molecular dynamics. The MoS2/Ti3C2Tx composites with an optimum mass ratio of MoS2 to Ti3C2Tx (6:1) displayed the best MWA performance. The minimum reflection loss (RL) value of −41.5 dB was attained with a layer thickness of only 2.0 mm at 12.2 GHz and a 3.6 GHz maximum efficacious absorption bandwidth. The MWA mechanism of MoS2/Ti3C2Tx composites was comprehended from multiple reflections and scattering effects, synergetic effects of conductive losses and attenuation capacity, and polarization relaxations. This work provides a facile method for the synthesis of 2D/2D heterostructure, and also provides a candidate material as potential microwave absorber.",Journal of Alloys and Compounds
Lacunary polyoxometalate @ ZIF for ultradeep Pb(II) adsorption,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdLacunary polyoxometalates (LPOMs), showing merits of designable coordination sites, may offer tremendous potential in toxic Pb(II) capture. However, their utilization is limited by their solubility in water and difficulty in reuse. Here, we report a self-assemble strategy to encapsulate LPOMs in customized cavities of ZIFs to afford reusable LPOM@ZIF adsorbents, with vacant oxygen sites tuned to afford efficient Pb(II) adsorption. It exhibited outstanding capture capacity of 764 mg g−1, extraordinary affinity with Kd of 2.87 × 107 mg L−1, and ultrarapid efficiency with h of 412.5 mg g−1 min−1 that could enable ultradeep water purification from 71770 ppb to 1.84 ppb within 15 min. Density functional theory calculation and experiments validated the contribution of oxygen in LPOMs on this impressive Pb(II) adsorption followed μ1–O > μ2–O > μ3–O, and –NH on ZIFs was another site. Outcomes thus reveal LPOM@ZIF is an appealing platform for ultradeep Pb(II) removal that could address the most urgent global health challenges.",Chemical Engineering Science

Here we report a strategy of controlling nucleation process via manipulating the collision of nucleation units, with the aim of disclosing the mechanism dominating the nucleation process. Silver nucleation is simulated at different collision conditions which is regulated by chemicals diffusion and reaction rate. It is found that the nucleation rate has a good linear relationship with the collision frequency, suggesting a collision dependent nucleation model.

Herein, an unreported material constructing strategy of combining crystalline-amorphous hetero-interface and heteroatomic doping towards electrocatalytic HER is firstly presented. The authors fabricate a self-supported P-MoS2/CoxSy@C/CFP electrode consisting of P-doped crystalline-amorphous MoS2/CoxSy heterojunction in-situ grown on carbon fiber paper (CFP). Benefitting from the strong electronic interaction at the interface of crystalline MoS2 and amorphous CoxSy, the electronic structure of MoS2/CoxSy@C/CFP is optimized. Moreover, the P doping can further optimize the electronic structure and enhance water adsorption of the catalyst and lower the kinetic energy barrier of HER. The heterojunction P-MoS2/CoxSy@C/CFP can not only exhibit excellent HER activity in alkaline electrolyte but also in acidic electrolyte, with the relatively lower overpotentials of 59 mV and 135 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm−2 in 1 M KOH and 0.5 M H2SO4; 140 mV and 205 mV at the current density of 100 mA cm−2 in 1 M KOH and 0.5 M H2SO4, respectively, which the HER performance is among the best for non-precious metal-based electrocatalysts usable in both acidic and alkaline mediums. Theoretical calculations also confirm that the construction of crystalline-amorphous heterointerface between MoS2 and CoxSy and P doping can effectively accelerate the electron transport and promote the HER reaction kinetics, thus enhancing the HER performance. This construction strategy for HER electrocatalyst provides a new avenue on electrocatalytic research.",Electrochimica Acta
"Iron-based electrocatalysts derived from scrap tires for oxygen reduction reaction: Evolution of synthesis-structure-performance relationship in acidic, neutral and alkaline media","© 2022 Elsevier LtdMass generation of scrap tires presents a major challenge for environmental safety, however, their upcycling into carbon-based nanomaterials by the virtue of pyrolysis treatments can open up new windows for energy conversion and storage technologies in the context of the circular economy. Herein, we report the synthesis of Fe-N-C oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) electrocatalyst for fuel cell (FC) applications using carbonaceous char derived from scrap tires through microwave-assisted pyrolysis (MAP). The char obtained from MAP was activated with potassium hydroxide and then pyrolyzed at a high temperature to fabricate Fe-N-C after mixing with iron and nitrogen precursors. Finally, the developed Fe-N-C was ball-milled and acid-etched for homogenization and leaching of iron oxide nanoparticles. In this study, structural evaluation during each synthesis step was elucidated and correlated with the ORR activity in all three pHs i.e. acidic, neutral, and alkaline. Moreover, the effect of electrocatalyst loading on ORR kinetics was also analyzed using two different loadings (0.2 and 0.6 mg cm−2) on the rotating ring disk electrode (RRDE). The developed Fe-N-C demonstrated encouraging onset potentials of 0.881, 0.822, and 0.936 V vs RHE in acidic, neutral, and alkaline conditions, respectively. Whereas the ORR activity was slightly reduced after the milling-etching step. Lower peroxide yield together with a tetra-electronic reduction of oxygen was witnessed in acidic and neutral conditions, however, peroxide production was increased in the alkaline medium.",Electrochimica Acta
Polyethylene oxide-engineered graphene with rich mesopores anchoring Bi2O3 nanoparticles for boosting CO2 electroreduction to formate,"© 2022Nanostructured Bi2O3 electrocatalysts for electrochemical reduction of CO2 (CO2ER) into formic acid (HCOOH) hold great promise due to low toxicity and inexpensive cost, but are still confronted with poor catalytic performance in the high overpotential region. Herein, the polyethylene oxide-engineered reduced graphene oxide (p-rGO) with rich mesopores was designed as the support of Bi2O3 nanoparticles for the efficient CO2ER to HCOOH. The resultant Bi2O3/p-rGO electrocatalyst delivered an outstanding faradaic efficiency of 94.3% with a competitive current density of -16.8 mA cm−2 at -1.09 VRHE, and maintained the faradaic efficiency above 90% over a wide potential range (-0.99 to -1.29 VRHE). The advanced performance of Bi2O3/p-rGO could be attributed to the integrated contributions of the unique mesoporous structure and the favorable support effect between p-rGO and Bi2O3. This work may provide a new design for the construction of metal/metal oxide on mesoporous reduced graphene to develop high-performance electrocatalysts for CO2ER.",Electrochimica Acta

The MoCu nanocrystals with a size of less than 10 nm are formed through the reduction-alloying of metal ions and well dispersed on the surface of the copper molybdenum oxide nanoplates (CMO). The CMO/MoCu nanocomposite is shown to possess a 2D–0D structure, a z-scheme charge mobility pathway, and excellent photocatalytic performance in ciprofloxacin (CFX) and tetracycline (TC) degradation. The anchored MoCu alloy nanoparticles on the surface of CMO plates provide remarkable charge separation, large surface area, and numerous accessible active sites for producing reactive species. The 2D–0D CMO/MoCu composite showed the highest catalytic activity with the activation energy of – 0.640 and – 0.923 kJ mol−1 for CFX and TC, respectively.

Co nanoparticles/N-doped carbon nanotubes: Facile synthesis by taking Co-based complexes as precursors and electrocatalysis on oxygen reduction reaction,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Carbon based non-precious metals and carbon-based materials have been widely demonstrated as promising electrocatalysts on oxygen reduction reaction. Nevertheless, how to control synthesize electrocatalysts effectively by employing a general path is still a great challenge. In this paper, we propose a facile strategy to grow Co nanoparticles/N-doped carbon nanotube hetero-structure from Co-based complexes with excellent electrocatalytic activity. By using different ligands (oleylamine, p-phenylenediamine, and 2-methylimidazole), Co-based complexes or metal-organic framework with the special morphologies were prepared and taken as templates for the Co nanoparticles/N-doped carbon nanotubes growing at high temperature. The as-prepared Co nanoparticles/N-doped carbon nanotubes perform high activity and excellent capacity on the electrocatalysis of oxygen reduction reaction. The onset potential and half-wave potential is measured as 0.92 VRHE and 0.84 VRHE respectively, which is very closed to the performance of commercial Pt/C(20%). Besides, the different Co-complexes with special morphologies are used as template for growing N-doped carbon nanotubes encapsulated Co nanoparticles and their corresponding electrocatalysis shows that the as-prepared Co nanoparticles/N-doped carbon nanotubes performance high capabilities on electrocatalysis of oxygen reduction reaction. The facile strategy for growing N-doped carbon nanotubes provides a possibility path to fabricate electrode on different substrate with excellent performance.",Colloids and Surfaces A: Physicochemical and Engineering Aspects
Modified Co electronic states in double-anionic CoPS nanocrystals induce highly efficient electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Pyrite-type CoS2 with half-metal properties has attracted more attention in the energy field because it is a kind of non-precious metal electrocatalyst with inexpensive, environmentally friendly, and sustainable merits. Particularly, it can produce significant spin-polarized electrons from Co electronic states to run efficient hydrogen evolution reactions (HER). In this work, we focus attention on double-anionic CoPS nanocrystals (NCs) and explore electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution performance. Theoretical calculations indicate that phosphorus introduction into CoS2 shifts the d-band of Co atom towards the Fermi surface, making the surface activation barrier of CoPS (0.98 eV) far lower than that of CoS2 (1.41 eV). By growing the rod-like Co3(PO4)2 with surface decoration of CoPS NCs on the CoS2 wrapped carbon fiber paper as electrochemical cathode, we show that such a composite structure can effectively improve the escape efficiency of H2 due to large specific surface area. The current density reaches 10 mA cm−2 at 47 mV. The tafel slope is only 52 mV dec−1, which is far smaller than that of CoS2. Spectroscopic characterization suggests that the modified electronic states of CoPS NCs and good charge transport kinetics in the compound are responsible for the observed high-efficiency HER performance. This study provides a useful strategy for designing and fabricating efficient electrocatalysts with synergistic effect of double anions and hierarchical activity.",Journal of Alloys and Compounds
ZIF-67 derived Mo2N/Mo2C heterostructure as high-efficiency electrocatalyst for hydrogen evolution reaction,"© 2022The development of high-performance electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution is essential and challenging. Recently, the engineering of nitride/carbide heterostructures with modulated heterointerfaces and strong synergistic effects has proven to be an effective strategy to improve catalytic performance.

The optimal Mo2N/Mo2C-8 catalyst showed a low overpotential of 88.1 mV at 10 mA cm−2 (η10) and a small Tafel slope (68.5 mV dec−1) in 1 M KOH, as well as great stability. The synergistic effects from the unique nanohybridization of the Mo2N/Mo2C heterostructure greatly enhance the intrinsic catalytic activity, and the porous structure promotes mass transfer efficiency, thereby improving the HER performance.

Ball mill-assisted synthesis of NiFeCo-NC as bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts for rechargeable zinc-air batteries,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are the core of clean energy technology. Oxygen electrocatalysts based on earth-abundant metals are of prime importance. Trimetallic catalysts have demonstrated reliable activities but their average performance, difficult synthesis techniques, and high synthesis costs limit their widespread use. Herein, the facile ball milling technique is introduced as an efficient and low-cost method for the synthesis of catalysts based on trimetallic NiFeCo nanometer-scale particles distributed over a CNT-graphene-like (NiFeCo-NC) structure. NiFeCo-NC is synthesized instantaneously from ball milling of melamine with industrial carbon nanotubes (CNTs) along with trimetallic particles. Results demonstrate that the NiFeCo-NC2 catalyst, synthesized from 2 g of melamine per 1 g of each metal salt, performed well in both ORR and OER. The potential difference between the half-wave reduction potential of the ORR (E1/2) and the oxidation potential at 10 mA cm−2 (E10) in OER reveals a better performance of the NiFeCo-NC2 as a bifunctional catalyst than other synthesized materials and reference catalysts. A zinc-air battery (ZAB) having the NiFeCo-NC2 catalyst performs better than the batteries using other catalysts. The NiFeCo-NC2 catalyst also exhibits excellent methanol tolerance, revealing its applicability for direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC) applications. Ball milling offers a simple, effective, versatile, and cost-effective mechano-chemical procedure for the concomitant one-pot mixing-synthesis of materials.",Journal of Alloys and Compounds
Synthesis of nickel@N-doped carbon nanotube foams for high sulfur-loading lithium-sulfur battery,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.The practical applications of lithium sulfur batteries have been greatly restricted by the polysulfide shuttle effect and non-conductivity of sulfur. Here, we report a nickel-catalyzed carbonization method to synthesize three-dimensional (3D) nickel@N-doped carbon-nanotube (CNT) foams for lithium-sulfur batteries. The corresponding carbon/sulfur cathode with a high sulfur loading of 3.71 mg cm−2 possesses a high initial capacity of 855.6 mAh g−1 at 135 mA g−1 and good cyclic stability with a low fading rate of 0.153% per cycle for 100 cycles at 270 mA g−1. The growth of carbon thin layers on the nickel nanoparticles results in the encapsulation of the nanoparticles in the CNTs, which makes the carbon forms highly conductive and prevents the metal nanoparticles from being oxidized by polysulfides. The high conductivity is favorable for the electron transfer between polysulfides and carbon electrode. Moreover, the doped nitrogen atoms on the CNTs have strong chemical adsorption ability for polysulfides, accelerating redox reaction of polysulfides on the carbon electrode (i.e., suppressing the shuttle effect). These unique structural characteristics well explain the excellent electrochemical performance of the assembled batteries. It is believed that the fabricated carbon foam is a promising material for high sulfur-loading lithium-sulfur battery.",Journal of Alloys and Compounds

However, the sluggish redox kinetics of lithium polysulfide (LPS) and its shuttling effects have impeded the practical applications of Li-S batteries. Single-atom catalysts (SACs) with atomically dispersed metal-based sites have been applied as a promising candidate for electrocatalysts for Li-S batteries. Herein, we design and demonstrate a single atom Fe-N/C catalyst impregnated with N, P–doped carbon (FeN6–NPC), N, P–doped carbon material (NPC), as well as Fe2P nanoparticles anchored with N, P–doped carbon (Fe2P–NPC). In-depth XANES and FT-EXAFS analyses were used to characterize the precise architecture of SACs containing Fe-N/C active sites. The electrochemical results of SACs with Fe-N/C active site configuration reveal the highest catalytic lithium polysulfide conversion compared to the NPC and nanoparticle anchored samples. In addition, the SACs enable FeN6–NPC/S electrode to deliver a high discharge capacity of 1115 mAh g−1 at 0.1 C and maintain 570 mAh g−1 after 200 cycles with excellent Columbic efficiency (>99%). This work successfully develops organic-based strategies for SACs that suppress lithium polysulfide formation, improve cyclic stability, and increase Coulombic efficiency for lithium-sulfur batteries.",Journal of Alloys and Compounds
Recent advances in non-noble metal-based bifunctional electrocatalysts for overall seawater splitting,"© 2022 The AuthorsSince seawater is one of the most abundant resources on earth, seawater electrolysis is becoming increasingly attractive for clean energy/hydrogen production. Although significant progress has been made recently, it is still challenging to obtain bifunctional electrocatalysts with high catalytic activity and durability suitable for seawater electrolysis because of the scarcity of precious metals and inadequate state-of-the-art materials for the overall reaction.

CoFe alloy and nitrogen doped carbon (CoFe-NC) material was prepared by a one-step carbonization procedure to construct a highly efficient electrocatalysis in this work. CoFe-NC displays a three-dimensional (3D) flower-like morphology composed of ordered stacked 2D nanosheets, which is entangled by 1D carbon nanotubes (CNTs). Its structure and electrocatalytic performance are compared with that of nitrogen doped carbon materials obtained from 2D zeolitic-imidazolate frameworks (ZIF) with no metal or single metal, as well as 3D ZIF with bimetal.

A combined TEM and SAXS study of the growth and self-assembly of ultrathin Pt nanowires,"© 2022 IOP Publishing Ltd.Ultrathin Pt nanowires possess high activity for various electrocatalytic applications. However, little work has focused on understanding their growth mechanisms. Herein, we utilize a combination of time-dependent, ex situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) techniques to observe the growth process in addition to associated surfactant-based interactions. TEM images indicate that initially nanoparticles are formed within 30 s; these small ‘seed’ particles quickly elongate to form ultrathin nanowires after 2 min. These motifs remain relatively unchanged in size and shape up to 480 min of reaction. Complementary SAXS data suggests that the initial nanoparticles, which are coated by a surfactant bilayer, arrange into a bcc superlattice. With increasing reaction time, the bcc lattice disappears as the nanoparticles grow into nanowires, which then self-assemble into a columnar hexagonal structure in which the individual nanowires are covered by a CTAB monolayer. The hexagonal structure eventually degrades, thereby leading to the formation of lamellar stacking phases comprised of surfactant bilayers. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that SAXS has been used to monitor the growth and self-assembly of Pt nanowires. These insights can be used to better understand and rationally control the formation of anisotropic motifs of other metallic nanostructures.",Nanotechnology

Leaf extract and their charge density distribution, electrochemical and biological performance","© 2022 Elsevier B.V.The present study investigates the electrochemical performance; charge density distribution, antimicrobial and antifungal activities of green synthesized silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) using the leaf extract of Datura metel L. UV–vis absorption spectrum shows that highly stable, monodispersed Ag NPs formed at 418 nm. Particle size analysis with zeta potential values 117 nm, − 27.3 mV are implied that hydrodynamic size with negative surface charges. Fourier transforms infrared (FTIR) analysis identified amide functional groups in Datura metel L. responsible for the reduction and stabilization of nanoparticles. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis showed about the spherical morphology and Energy Dispersive Absorption X-ray (EDAX) spectrum displays the Ag peak at 3.1 KeV with encapsulation of organic trace elements. X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) analysis exhibit's Ag 3d, Ag 3p, and Ag 3s chemical state of Ag NPs and the X-ray Diffraction (XRD) pattern confirmed the crystalline nature at 38.1˚ with organometallic phases. The structure factors in the single unit cells are studied in about three, two, and one-dimensional profiles using the Rietveld refinement technique. The complex of atropine with the nanoparticle was modeled using the MOPS method. The formation of the complex is carried out due to the transfer of the electron density of Ag NPs to the atropine molecule, which consists of more electronegative atoms. A charge transfer complex in which the nanoparticle acquires a charge of +0.354 and the atropine – 0.354 is formed.

Effect of the number of graphene layers on the electron transfer kinetics at metal/graphene heterostructures,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.We theoretically investigated the kinetics of outer-sphere electron transfer (ET) at graphene with different number of layers in the presence and absence of metal substrates using density functional theory (DFT) calculations. It is shown that the experimental data on the electrocatalytic activity of the metal substrate for few-layer graphene can be explained under the assumption of the nonadiabatic electron transfer. However, the electron transfer at the metal-supported single-layer graphene is likely adiabatic. The enhanced electron transfer in the presence of the metal substrate is explained by the hybridization of the metal and graphene electronic states, which provides more efficient interaction of the metal substrate with the reactant near the graphene surface.",Journal of Electroanalytical Chemistry

However, the materials utilized to make paper-based POC rarely produce multiple signals, hampering further applications in diverse situations. Herein, we present an appealing approach, namely Colorimetric-Temperature Dual-Signal Output Sensor (CTDSS), and construct a CTDSS based on coordinative self-assembly biomimetic nanozymes Fe-GMP-L-His CPNs as a proof of concept. These CPNs mimic the structure of horseradish peroxidase (HRP), in which Fe (II) is the center, nucleotide GMP and histidine are chosen as ligands to simulate metal coordination of the pyrrole ring and protein function in HRP, respectively. This strategy allows CPNs to show an excellent peroxidase-like activity, efficiently converting H2O2 into •OH and oxidizing TMB to generate colorimetric-temperature dual-signal. As a proof-of-concept application, we exploited cholesterol as the target and successfully applied this CTDSS to detect cholesterol, displaying extraordinary features of rapidity, dramatic specificity, and high sensitivity. By utilizing the colorimetric test strip and temperature discoloration sticker, the paper-based POC tools were constructed to visualize the target. Meanwhile, two proposed test strip POC devices generating different signal outputs exhibited remarkable feasibility and were further employed to detect cholesterol in human serum. We anticipate that this CTDSS platform will inspire innovative concepts for future portable detection tools.",Biosensors and Bioelectronics

A new CoFe1.9Li0.1O4 spinel oxide cathode for proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells,"© 2022 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.A new spinel oxide CoFe1.9Li0.1O4 (CFLO) has been synthesized as a cathode material for proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells. CFLO has good structure stability up to 900 °C. In addition, the material can survive in both CO2 and steam-containing atmospheres. Compared with the Li-free sample, the Li-doping strategy significantly regulates the material's electronic structure. The low valence of Li leads to the increased amount of Fe and Co cations with higher valences. Furthermore, doping Li creates more oxygen vacancies at the material surface, which benefits the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The improved cathode performance for CFLO has been demonstrated that a cell using CFLO cathode reaches a peak power density of 1052 mW cm−2 at 700 °C. The cell performance is 60% larger than the Li-free cell, and similar results can be detected at other testing temperatures. In addition, the CFLO cell shows good long-term stability in the working condition. This study proposes the Li-doping strategy to modify spinel oxides and also provides a new spinel oxide as a high-performing cathode for H–SOFCs.",Ceramics International
Cu-Based Tandem Catalysts for Electrochemical CO2 Reduction,"© Editorial office of Acta Physico-Chimica Sinica.Through the combustion of fossil fuels and other human activities, large amounts of CO2 gas have been emitted into the atmosphere, causing many environmental problems, such as the greenhouse effect and global warming. Thus, developing and utilizing renewable clean energy is crucial to reduce CO2 emission and achieve carbon neutrality. The electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) has been considered as an effective approach to obtain high value-added chemicals and fuels, which can store intermittent renewable energy and achieve the artificial carbon cycle. In addition, due to its multiple advantages, such as mild reaction conditions, tunable products, and simple implementation, electrochemical CO2RR has attracted extensive attention. Electrochemical CO2RR involves multiple electron–proton transfer steps to obtain multitudinous products, such as C1 products (CO, HCOOH, CH4, etc.) and C2 products (C2H4, C2H5OH, etc.). The intermediates, among which* CO is usually identified as the key intermediate, and reaction pathways of different products intersect, resulting in an extremely complex reaction mechanism. Currently, copper has been widely proven to be the only metal catalyst that can efficiently reduce CO2 to hydrocarbons and oxygenates due to its suitable adsorption energy for* CO. However, the low product selectivity, poor stability, and high overpotential of pure Cu hinder its use for the production of industrial-grade multi-carbon products. Tandem catalysts with multiple types of active sites can sequentially reduce CO2 molecules into desired products. When loaded onto a co-catalyst that can efficiently convert CO2 to* CO (such as Au and Ag), Cu acts as an electron donor owing to its high electrochemical potential.* CO species generated from the substrate can spillover onto the surface of electron-poor Cu due to the stronger adsorption and be further reduced to C2+ products. The use of Cu-based tandem catalysts for electrochemical CO2RR is a promising strategy for improving the performance of CO2RR and thus, has become a research hotspot in recent years. In this review, we first introduce the reaction routes and tandem mechanisms of electrochemical CO2RR. Then, we systematically summarize the recent research progress of Cu-based tandem catalysts for electrochemical CO2RR, including Cu-based metallic materials (alloys, heterojunction, and core-shell structures) as well as Cu-based framework materials, carbon materials, and polymer-modified materials. Importantly, the preparation methods of various Cu-based tandem catalysts and their structure–activity relationship in CO2RR are discussed and analyzed in detail. Finally, the challenges and opportunities of the rational design and controllable synthesis of advanced tandem catalysts for electrochemical CO2RR are proposed.",Wuli Huaxue Xuebao/ Acta Physico - Chimica Sinica
Tuning the Coordination Structure of Single Atoms and Their Interaction with the Support for Carbon Dioxide Electroreduction,"© Editorial office of Acta Physico-Chimica Sinica.The combustion of fossil fuels increases atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations, leading to adverse impacts on the planetary radiation balance and, consequently, on the climate. Fossil fuel utilization has contributed to a marked rise in global temperatures, now at least 1.2 °C above ‘pre-industrial’ levels. To meet the 2015 Paris Agreement target of 1.5 °C above pre-industrial levels, considerable efforts are required to efficiently capture and utilize CO2. Among the different strategies developed for converting CO2, electrochemical CO2 reduction (ECR) to valuable chemicals using renewable energy is expected to revolutionize the manufacture of sustainable “green” chemicals, thereby achieving a closed anthropogenic carbon cycle. However, CO2 is a thermodynamically stable and kinetically inert molecule that requires high electrical energy to bend the linear O＝C＝O bond by attacking the C atom. To facilitate the ECR with good energy efficiency, it is essential to lower the reaction overpotential as well as maintain a high current density and desirable product selectivity; therefore, the design and development of advanced electrocatalysts are crucial. A plethora of heterogeneous and homogeneous materials has been explored in the ECR. Among these materials, single-atom catalysts (SACs) have been the focus of most extensive research in the context of ECR. A SAC with isolated metal atoms dispersed on a supporting host exhibits a unique electronic structure, well-defined coordination environment, and an extremely high atom utilization maximum; thus, SACs have emerged as promising materials over the last two decades. Single-atom catalysis has covered the periodic table from d-block and ds-block metals to p-block metals. The types of support materials for SACs, ranging from metal oxides to tailored carbon materials, have also expanded. The adsorption strength and catalytic activity of SACs can be effectively tuned by modulating the central metal and local coordination structure of the SACs. In this article, we discuss the progress made to date in the field of single-atom catalysis for promoting ECR. We provide a comprehensive review of state-of-the-art SACs for the ECR in terms of product distribution, selectivity, partial current density, and performance stability. Special attention is paid to the modification of SACs to improve the ECR efficiency. This includes tailoring the coordination of the heteroatom, constructing bimetallic sites, engineering the morphologies and surface defects of supports, and regulating surface functional groups. The correlation of the coordination structure of SACs and metal-support interactions with ECR performance is analyzed. Finally, development opportunities and challenges for the application of SACs in the ECR, especially to form multi-carbon products, are presented.",Wuli Huaxue Xuebao/ Acta Physico - Chimica Sinica
Recent advances in the application of carbon nitrides for advanced water treatment and desalination technology,"© 2022Carbon nitride (CN) and its different derivatives have received increased research consideration in current materials science because of its extensive range of potential applications in environmental protection. At present, the graphitic CN (g-C3N4), an important two-dimensional layered material, has been used in different areas like energy conversion, photocatalysis, and environmental contamination management. Its derivatives have also drawn huge research attention because of its intrinsic characters of their stable chemical and physical properties, eco-friendly nature, and inexpensive feature. This review focuses on the recent studies discussing the application of CNs for desalination and water treatment. In this study, the membrane-based application, photocatalytic application, adsorption application, and electrode-based application of CNs for water treatment and desalination have been discussed. In the membrane-based application, the use of microporous g-C3N4, microporous C2N, and microporous C3N for desalination (reverse osmosis, forward osmosis, nanofiltration), pervaporation, ultrafiltration, oil-in-water separation, and dye separation have been detailed. Moreover, the photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants (dyes, pharmaceuticals, etc.) and metal ions by CNs have been examined in detail. Further, the adsorption application of CNs for the adsorption of dyes, metal ions, and surfactants has been studied. It was noted that CN and its different derivatives are suitable candidates as membrane materials, photocatalysts, adsorbents, and electrode materials for their effective application in desalination and water treatment.",Desalination
A novel 3D Co/Mo co-catalyzed graphene sponge-mediated peroxymonosulfate activation for the highly efficient pollutants degradation,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.A novel 3D Co/Mo co-catalyzed graphene sponges (SCMG) was fabricated by a simple impregnation pyrolysis method, and successfully applied as a highly efficient heterogeneous catalyst in peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation for rapid and complete elimination of rhodamine B (RhB) within 2 min. The introduction of O contributed to enhanced electron transfer ability of the sponge, and 3D melamine sponges as substrates provided a highly dispersed support for Co/Mo heterojunction. MoS2 co-catalysis accelerated Co(III)/Co(II) conversion and promoted the generation of 1O2, which ensured an improved catalytic activity. The main reactive oxygen species in the SCMG/PMS system were 1O2 and SO4.-, which contributed to a high reactivity over a wide range of pH (3–9). SCMG/PMS system were highly resistant to anions (Cl-, SO42- and H2PO4-) and natural organic matter (humic acid), and could be widely used for the degradation of common organic contaminants. Besides, SCMG has good reusability and stability, and the metal leaching was well below existing safety standards over a wide pH range. This work broadens the application range of metal co-catalysis and provides a promising heterogeneous Fenton-like catalyst in refractory organic wastewater treatment.",Separation and Purification Technology
Microenvironment Modulation of Imine-Based Covalent Organic Frameworks for CO2 Photoreduction,"© 2022 SIOC, CAS, Shanghai, & WILEY-VCH GmbH.Photocatalytic CO2 reduction to fuels and chemicals has been considered as the promising avenue to realize carbon resource recycling. Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with pre-designed and tailorable structures are promising platforms for studying the influence of the microenvironment of catalysts on photocatalytic CO2 reduction. Herein, we report three isomorphic COFs (TPHH-COF, TPPD-COF and TPBD-COF) as heterogeneous photocatalysts for CO2 reduction and investigate the different levels of conjugation and planarity of COFs effect on the catalytic activity. Photoelectrochemical measurements show that TPPD-COF has a narrower band gap and faster photocurrent response compared to TPHH-COF and TPBD-COF, probably due to the moderate conjugation and planarity. As the photocatalyst, TPPD-COF showed the most outstanding photocatalytic activity with the production rates of 951 and 157 μmol·g–1·h–1 for CO and H2, respectively. This study illustrates the close relation between microenvironment and photocatalytic activity and provides new insights for designing high-performance photocatalysts.",Chinese Journal of Chemistry
Exploiting layered double hydroxide with modulated atomic motifs enables enhanced peroxydisulfate activation,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Exploring advanced Fenton-like catalysts with modulated local structure and grasping how the atomic motifs govern the activity and stability is a major challenge. Herein, a series of nickel–iron layered double hydroxides (NiFe-LDH) with regulated local atomic structure were presented via introducing Fe2+ to partially substitute the Ni2+-site, thereby constructing Fe-O-Fe motifs. These regulated Fe2+ containing NiFe-LDHs (Fe2+-NiFe-LDH) demonstrated enhanced catalytic performance on peroxydisulfate (PDS) activation compared with pristine NiFe-LDH. Remarkable degradation efficiency was achieved: about 92.5 % of Orange II (30 mg·L−1) could be degraded within 60 min. Meanwhile, other simulated wastewater of tetracycline, bisphenol A, and ciprofloxacin were capable of achieving efficient removal as well. Detailed characterizations elucidated that the substitution of Fe2+ resulted in the formation of Fe-O-Fe couplings, which functioned as novel motifs and accounted for the expressively promoted intrinsic catalytic performance. Simultaneously, the incorporated Fe-O-Fe motifs can improve electrochemical properties, thereby accelerating the electron transfer between catalysts and oxidants, further clarifying the exceptionally enhanced catalytic activity. Furthermore, density functional theory (DFT) calculations corroborated that Fe2+ substitution could modulate surface electronic state, give rise to strengthened binding energy, and intensify electron transfer for PDS activation. Moreover, other Fe-O-M (M represents Co, Cu, Mn) motifs were also constructed within NiFe-LDH structure, with Co exhibiting the superior catalytic performance. This work conclusively proved the significance of tailoring the local atomic structure for constructing high-efficiency catalysts, and predicted to stimulate the rational design of LDHs-based catalysts.",Separation and Purification Technology
Integrating LiF-rich solid electrolyte interphase and in-situ formed gel blocking layer for Li–S battery,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Engineering stable interface protective films are imperative to enable lithium-sulfur (Li–S) batteries long-term cycling as they can suppress the growth of Li dendrites and shuttle effect of Li polysulfides, which have been recognized as two major challenges for plaguing the practical implementation of Li–S batteries. However, most of these efforts only pay attention to one side of Li metal anode or cathode. Herein, we report a facile yet effective strategy that simultaneously overcomes the aforementioned challenges by using Li hexafluorophosphate/fluoroethylene carbonate (LiPF6/FEC) solution immersed separator, resulting in a LiF-rich solid electrolyte interphase film at the surface of Li metal anode and an in-situ formed gel blocking layer on the separator-cathode interface. With joint theoretical calculations and characterization techniques, we confirm that the Li–S battery using the LiPF6/FEC soaked separator can achieve a better rate performance and cycling stability than that of using routine PE separator. This work provides a creative design for boosting the development of high-performance rechargeable batteries not limited Li–S battery.",Journal of Power Sources
A novel 0D/2D/2D hetero-layered nitrogen-doped graphene/MoS2 architecture for catalytic hydrogen evolution reaction,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdTwo-dimensional (2D) layered molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) has emerged as a promising Pt-substituting electrocatalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) recently. Despite the ever-growing interest in these MoS2 based-materials, their catalytic performance is still far from satisfactory due to the nature of the inactive basal plane and poor conductivity. This work presents a novel nickel@nitrogen-doped graphene@MoS2 (Ni@N-Gr/MoS2) triad heterostructure for catalytic HER. The as-synthesized Ni@N-Gr/MoS2 assembly exhibits high intrinsic HER activity with a low overpotential of 270 mV at 10 mA cm−2, an onset overpotential of 60 mV, a small Tafel slope of 56 mV dec−1, and robust stability in 0.5 M H2SO4. The notable activity of the Ni@N-Gr/MoS2 composites is attributed to two main causes (i) presence of further catalytic active sites due to the incorporation of Ni@N-Gr in the basal plane of MoS2 (ii) improvement of the conductivity due to nitrogen-doped Gr; where a fast electron transfer takes place from Ni@N-Gr core to MoS2 during HER. Our novel-hybrid strategy is promising as an electrochemical platform in industrial hydrogen production and hence can stimulate further structural realizations to employ other metal species.",Fuel
Fabrication of visible-light-active Fe-2MI film electrode for simultaneous removal of Cr(VI) and phenol,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdIn this study, a new coordination polymer of Fe-2-methylimidazole (Fe-2MI) was successfully loaded onto F-doped tin oxide (FTO) via a one-pot solvothermal method, using Fe(NO3)3 and 2MI as raw materials. For X-ray diffraction patterns (XRD) and scanning electron microscope (SEM) analysis, it can be deduced that Fe-2MI assembles were evenly dispersed on the surface of FTO, and were partially encapsulated by tiny FeOOH particles. The as-prepared Fe-2MI film electrode was used as photoanode with titanium sheet (Ti) as the cathode. Simultaneous photoelectrocatalytic (PEC) removal of phenol and Cr(VI) can be effortlessly accomplished under noticeable light illumination. Meanwhile, the impact of initial Fe state was also investigated. Fe-2MI prepared with Fe(III) behaved better PEC performance than that with Fe(II). Furthermore, the Fe-2MI photoanodes were optimized by adjusting the initial concentration of Fe(III) and 2MI precursors. Besides, the application conditions were optimized at acidic pHs and 2.5 V bias voltage. Cr(VI) can be completely reduced with 80% removal of phenol after 5 h PEC reaction. After 5 successive cyclic runs, stable photocatalytic performance can still be observed. Therefore, Fe-2MI coordination polymer can be a promising candidate for preparing visible-light-active photoanode in the application of environmental remediation.",Materials Science in Semiconductor Processing
"Efficient functionalization of reduced graphene oxide by 3-(pyridin-2-yl)-1,2,4,5-tetrazine and design of hybrids with silver nanoparticles for electrocatalysis","© 2022 Elsevier B.V.The efficiency of graphene functionalization by 3-(pyridin-2-yl)-1,2,4,5-tetrazine using inverse demand Diels-Alder reaction was investigated in comparison with the symmetrical 3,6-bis(2-pyridyl)-1,2,4,5-tetrazine. Elemental compositions on the surface of functionalized graphene were analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), evidencing the higher amount of nitrogen when using the H-substituted tetrazine derivative. In a second step, silver nanoparticles were electrodeposited on these functionalized graphene sheets to enhance the electrocatalytic properties of graphene. The amount of silver determined by XPS increases with the amount of nitrogen introduced on graphene as it was intended for. The electrocatalytic properties have been assessed on the Oxygen Reduction Reaction (ORR), showing good performances in terms of ORR potential even with very small amounts of silver compared to previously reported data.",Materials Chemistry and Physics
Diversity and recent progressive trend in MOFs-based photo-electrocatalysts for selective CO2 reduction,"© 2022 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.Structural formations of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are predominately composed of empty space pockets inside a honeycomb structure assembled of organic linkers and metal ions, with the exception of a few small pockets of filled spaces. However, these extraordinary filled pockets provide a valuable resource as its applications when it comes through in various active areas. Recently, taking advantage of the rare combination of porosity, high surface area, and charge conductivity incorporated in MOFs applications such as electronic sensors, charge storage devices, electrocatalysts, and others previously outside the scope, but now has been developed. This review envisioned a scenario by presenting a piece of individual and collective established studies and investigations during the last few years for carbon dioxide reduction (CO2R) as MOF-based composites adjacent with semiconductor, photosensitizer, and conductive photo-electrocatalysts are discussed. Various strategies have been discussed to improve photo-electrocatalysts' performance by synthesis, bandgap engineering, and mobilizing the catalyst surface for optimizing yield. Moreover, the reaction mechanisms to drive the MOF, operational, improve stability, and evaluation approaches are summarized.

Peroxydisulfate activation by 2D MOF-derived Ni/Fe3O4 nanoparticles decorated in 3D graphene oxide network,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Metal organic framework (MOF)-derived materials normally have three-dimensional (3D) structure, while little attention has been paid to two-dimensional (2D) MOF-derived materials with high catalytic activity. Nevertheless, the underlying agglomeration and metal leaching issues of 2D MOF-derived catalysts hinder their real applications. In this work, we report a bimetallic nanocomposite (Ni-Fe-C-600-acid/GO) derived from 2D Ni-Fe-MOF and graphene oxide (GO) network. Employing Ni(0) and Fe3O4 as active site, the Ni-Fe-C-600-acid/GO shows high efficiency in peroxydisulfate (PDS) activation for the removal of p-chloroaniline (PCA), and the catalyst/PCA dosage ratio (0.8) is substantially lower than those of the previous studies (3.9–156.9). The prepared catalysts demonstrate high catalytic activity over a wide pH range of 3–9 and maintain high efficiency after five cycles with good tolerance to inorganic anions. The singlet oxygen is identified as the predominant active species and relatively weak contributions from sulfate free radicals and hydroxyl radicals are confirmed. This catalysis system presents new insights in 2D MOF-derived catalysts in advanced oxidation processes.",Separation and Purification Technology
Atomically dispersed Ru3 site catalysts for electrochemical sensing of small molecules,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Rational design and construction of electrochemical sensing platforms with high sensitivity and selectivity is one of the challenges in practical application. Although single-atom catalysts (SACs) have attracted extensive attention, atomically dispersed metal catalysts (ADCs) with multi-atom sites can further compensate for the deficiencies of SACs, which have gradually been a research hotspot in recent years. Herein, atomically dispersed Ru3 site catalyst (Ru3/NC) is employed to catalyze small biomolecule oxidation, which exhibits much superior electrocatalytic ability of uric acid (UA) to Ru single-atom catalyst (Ru1/NC). What's more, theoretical calculations reveal that the enhanced performance is mainly derived from the dominant electronic structure of ADCs with multi-atom sites compared to SACs, leading to the more favorable adsorption of hydroxy anion groups, which can serve as one part of the active moiety and “promoter” to achieve the fast oxidation of small biomolecules. Our findings provide a new paradigm for designing promising catalysts to realize highly sensitive and selective small biomolecule detection and explore the catalytic mechanisms of small biomolecules at the atomic scale.",Biosensors and Bioelectronics

The optimized CeO2/α-MoC/β-Mo2C MRs/CC electrode exhibits very low overpotentials of 22 and 29 mV at 10 mA cm−2 for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alkaline freshwater and seawater, outperforming most of the reported molybdenum carbide-based electrocatalysts. Meanwhile, it could maintain long-term stability for over 100 h at a large current density of 1000 mA·cm−2. Theoretical study and experimental results reveal that the synergistic effects of α-MoC, β-Mo2C, and oxygen vacancy-rich CeO2 can effectively promote the dissociation of water molecules, tailor the d‐band electronic structure of MoxC with a thermoneutral hydrogen adsorption free energy, increase the numbers of active sites, and facilitate the vectorial electron transfer, thus achieving an enhanced HER performance.

A systematic review on recent advances of metal–organic frameworks-based nanomaterials for electrochemical energy storage and conversion,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.The progress of environment friendly and cost-effective energy storage and conversion technologies to combat pollution and the impending energy problem has recently attracted the attention of the energy research society. The fabrication of materials to accumulate charge or expedite mass and electron transference in energy storage and transformation fields is imperative. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have been extensively utilized as worthy precursors for the production of carbon resources, metal–metal composites, and their combinations with variable and governable nanoscale structures and elemental configurations for electrochemical energy applications through evolving crystal-like mesoporous organic and inorganic hybrid constituents have been reported. However, the poor electrical conductivity and constricted nanopores of MOFs have been highlighted. Henceforth, MOF combinations, where MOFs are linked with a diversity of efficient components, have been found to alleviate the drawbacks of distinct modules. 0D nanomaterials, like quantum dots, 1D nanomaterials, like nanotubes, 2D nanolayered materials, and 3D nanostructured materials could be combined with MOFs to develop numerous MOF composites. In this review, we described several synthesis procedures of MOF compounds, with a special focus on the expansion of MOF based materials for several electrochemical energy storing and transformation submissions, such as, lithium-ion batteries, lithium-sulfur batteries, supercapacitors, water splitting, oxygen reduction reaction, CO2 reduction reaction, N2 reduction reaction, and photovoltaic cells.

"Theoretical study on the stabilities, electronic structures, and reaction and formation mechanisms of fullerenes and endohedral metallofullerenes","© 2022 Elsevier B.V.The elucidation of geometries is the fundamental to further investigate and develop fullerene chemistry, an epoch-making discipline since 1985. Although the geometries of fullerenes, including their derivatives, could be characterized by various experimental methods, single-crystal X-ray diffraction is the only precise one. Notably, the electronic structures and reaction mechanisms cannot be clearly studied in experiment. Theoretical study is a valid and credible choice with foresight. In this account, we highlight the advanced theoretical contributions to the structures, reaction mechanisms, and formation mechanisms of fullerenes, including endohedral fullerenes (EFs). Several rules previously proposed were highlighted to screen the stabilities of (endohedral) fullerenes. In addition, the semi-empirical molecular orbital methods (SEMOMs), molecular dynamics, and Hartree-Fock (HF) method are also performed to characterize the relative stability of EFs. Subsequently, with the developments of theoretical level and computational efficiency, density functional theory (DFT) computation combined with statistic thermodynamically analysis (STA) is successful for predicting the stable isomers of EFs, on which the first non-IPR EF, Ce@C70, was revealed. In addition, the results of the single-crystal X-ray diffraction results confirm many of theoretical predictions. The long-range corrections in DFT play a key role in the study of Sc2C2n system. Additionally, the electronic structures of EFs have also been studied in theory, and there is no choice but to the theoretical study on reaction mechanism of EFs. The experimental method is languorous on the fullerene-formation mechanism, including endohedral fullerenes, which is still ambiguous up to now, due to the ultra-formation conditions. There is much theoretical evidence for the fullerene-formation process based on top-down and bottom-up models. At the end, the machine learning is expected to be used in fullerene chemistry in the future.",Coordination Chemistry Reviews
Bimetal-organic framework-derived nanotube@cellulose aerogels for peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdMetal-organic frameworks (MOFs) and their derived powder catalysts are prone to agglomerate and difficult to recycle in water, thus resulting in their low utilization and secondary pollution in water treatment. Herein, a composite aerogel (CoFe0.8@NCNT@CA) loaded with bimetallic MOF-derived carbon nanotubes on cellulose aerogel was developed for activating peroxymonosulfate (PMS) to degrade tetracycline (TC). The CoFe0.8@NCNT@CA/PMS system exhibits an excellent TC removal rate (97.1 % TC removal within 20 min). The outstanding performance of the composite catalyst is closely related to the synergistic effect of bimetallic catalytic sites, graphitic N structure, and porous network. Interestingly, carbon nanotubes and cellulose in the composite catalyst form a semi-coated porous structure, which can effectively enhance the adhesion of carbon nanotubes and expose abundant active sites while ensuring mass transfer. This study provides a strategy for synthesizing novel composite aerogel with an excellent structure and physicochemical properties for water treatment.",Carbohydrate Polymers
Developments of the heterogeneous and homogeneous CO2 hydrogenation to value-added C2+-based hydrocarbons and oxygenated products,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.The escalating energy demand has persuaded the scientific community to advent efficient methods for the utilization of carbon neutral fuels with existing technologies. CO2, being a major component of greenhouse gases, draws more attention towards carbon capture and utilization (CCU) into energy rich products. Among all the CCU products, higher hydrocarbons, alcohols, and ethers are more desirable than low carbon-based products due to their featuring high energy density and minimal emissions. In this context, major advancements are being achieved in the production of fuels and fuel additives like ethanol, ethylene, ethane, dimethyl ether, light olefins (C2–C4 olefins), jet fuels (C8–C16 alkanes and cycloalkanes), aromatic products, etc. from CO2 hydrogenation reaction. Hence, it is imperative to compile and analyze its important features regarding catalyst environment, mechanistic insights, conversion efficiency, product selectivity and so on from both experimental and theoretical perspectives. In our review, we comprehensively evaluate the developments towards promoting CO2 hydrogenation to high carbon-based products. We intend to present the possible schemes, current challenges, and the expected future research pathways towards designing efficient catalytic systems for CO2 reduction reaction. We expect such a review is of immense research interest and will motivate the scientific world in the direction of large-scale industrial production of clean energy fuels.",Coordination Chemistry Reviews
Room-temperature half-metallicity in rich Ti-alloyed CrSi2N4 monolayer,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.A new family of MoSi2N4-type monolayers have been extensively studied since it was recently synthesized, but half-metallic behavior is observed infrequently and unstable in the new family. Here, based on antiferromagnetic semiconductor CrSi2N4 monolayer, we predict a ferromagnetic half-metallicity (FHM) in alloy compound TiCrSi4N8 monolayer with a minority-spin gap of 3 eV and a considerable magnetic anisotropy energy by applying first-principles calculations. The FHM of TiCrSi4N8 are robust against biaxial strain from −3% to 3%. The TiCrSi4N8 belongs to XY ferromagnet with negligible in-plane magnetocrystalline anisotropy and the Curie temperature is estimated to be near room temperature by Monte Carlo simulation with the consideration of symmetric and antisymmetric exchange interactions. Such a FHM at room temperature may be permitted in the range of Ti concentrations from 0.5 to 0.75. Strong d−−d hybridization between Cr and Ti atoms and the larger exchange splitting of Cr-d orbitals with respect to Ti-d orbitals are origin of the HM and magnetic moment of Cr atom, and ferromagnetic coupling between Cr atoms is due to the Cr–N–Cr superexchange interaction. Besides, the applied potentials of TiCrSi4N8 are further expanded by the large Young's modulus and strong bending resistance. Thus, the rich Ti-alloyed CrSi2N4 monolayers are noteworthy candidates for generating spin current source.",Journal of Magnetism and Magnetic Materials
Design and syntheses of hybrid zeolitic imidazolate frameworks,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Zeolites are widely used in industrial catalysis and many aspects of our daily life. Zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) have been developed by mimicking the structural characteristics of zeolite through coordination chemistry method. ZIFs have attracted extensive attention because of their high surface area and adjustable pore size and pore environment. The emerging hybrid zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (HZIFs) contain TO4 unit of zeolite and metal-imidazole tetrahedral unit (MIm4) of ZIFs which fill the gap between zeolite and ZIFs. HZIFs inherit the merits of zeolite and ZIFs such as high stability, high porosity and so on. HZIFs has wide applications in electrocatalysis, photocatalysis, ion storage, capacitors, electrochemical identification, microwave adsorption and so on. The emergence of this material has greatly promoted the progress and development of material chemistry, coordination chemistry and structural chemistry.

The challenges and perspectives of the rational design and syntheses of new HZIFs are also discussed.",Coordination Chemistry Reviews
Coordinating single-atom catalysts on two-dimensional nanomaterials: A paradigm towards bolstered photocatalytic energy conversion,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.The development of photocatalysts with robust active sites, excellent light-harvesting ability, low electron-hole recombination, and superior activity has been employed over the past decades. Recently, single-atom engineering emerged as a new frontier owing to its exceptional performance in ameliorating photocatalysis. Single-atom photocatalysts endow remarkable electronic structures, maximal atomic utilization efficiency, unsaturated coordination centers, high catalytic activity and selectivity. This review summarizes the advancement of single-atom catalysis (SAC) anchored on two-dimensional (2D) substrates (SA@2D) for photocatalytic energy conversion during the past five years. We will begin with the basic traits of SACs followed by casting an overview of different synthetic approaches and characterization techniques related to SACs. Next, the potential for 2D materials as auspicious substrates of single-atom photocatalysts and the approaches for stabilizing single atoms on the 2D substrates are discussed. In view of the peculiarities of different single-atoms categories (e.g. noble-metal, transition-metal and metal-free SAC), the emerging properties and roles of SAC in photocatalysis are highlighted.

"Metal oxides for the electrocatalytic reduction of carbon dioxide: Mechanism of active sites, composites, interface and defect engineering strategies","© 2022 Elsevier B.V.The electrochemical reduction of CO2 into fine chemicals, assisted with renewable energy, is the most instant approach for balancing the atmospheric CO2 level, as well as for storing solar energy as chemical energy. Due to their easy synthesis and good performance, metal oxides are attractive as electrocatalysts for the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). In this review article, we concise the recent advances in the product efficiency of CO2RR for metal oxide electrocatalysts. It is here worth noticing that, overlooking the metal sites of metal oxide-based catalysts, we only considered the M−O (metal–oxygen bond) active sites for discussion. Further, recent strategies, such as advanced morphologies development and interface and vacancy defect engineering, used to improve the CO2RR performance, are also overviewed. By covering the critical role of catalysts (M−O) structure in efficiency and stability, this review also provides some future aspects for the design and development of efficient metal oxide-based electrocatalysts for CO2RR.",Coordination Chemistry Reviews
Overpotential regulation of vanadium-doped chitosan carbon aerogel cathode promotes heterogeneous electro-Fenton degradation efficiency,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.This work aimed at exploring the effect of optimal overpotential discrepancy between two-electron oxygen reduction reaction (OP2eORR) and metal reduction reaction (OPMRR) of the cathode on electro-Fenton (EF) system performance, and proposing strategy to eliminate overpotential discrepancy. Therefore, series of vanadium-doped chitosan carbon aerogel (xCCA-V) cathodes were fabricated by controlling graphitization degree. With carbonized temperature of 900 °C, the OP2eORR of the 900CCA-V was −0.5 V vs. SCE, the same with the OP for vanadium reduction reaction (OPVRR). This identical OP of the 900CCA-V endowed excellent EF performance, with ciprofloxacin removal of 98.1%, and TOC removal significantly increased by 41.8% compared with Ferrum-doped CCA (900CCA-Fe). Density functional theory calculation revealed efficient active sites for H2O2 adsorption on the 900CCA-V surface. Degradation pathways of ciprofloxacin and intermediates toxicity were determined. This work provides inspiration for developing strategy for overpotential regulation and design novel and efficient cathodes for enhancing EF performance.",Applied Catalysis B: Environmental
Formation of hollow frameworks of dual-sided Fe/Fe3C@N-doped carbon nanotubes as bifunctional oxygen electrocatalyst for Zn-air batteries,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Rational design of effective bifunctional inexpensive oxygen electrocatalyst is highly important for Zn-air batteries (ZABs), which can accelerate both oxygen reduction/evolution reactions at the oxygen electrode. Herein, we present the formation of hierarchical hollow frameworks of dual-sided Fe/Fe3C@N-doped carbon nanotubes (FNCHFs) through a template-engaged method. Benefitting from the synergistic effect between the robust hollow frameworks and in-situ grown dual-sided N-doped carbon nanotubes, the FNCHF electrocatalyst presents enhanced mass/electron transport with high structural stability. As a result, the FNCHFs based bifunctional oxygen electrode demonstrates a desirable oxygen electrocatalytic activity and stability with a half-wave potential of 0.863 V for oxygen reduction and an overpotential of 340 mV to reach the current density of 10 mA cm−2 for oxygen evolution. The corresponding ZAB exhibits a high peak power density of 206 mW cm−2, a high specific capacity of 781 mAh gZn−1, and a good cycling stability more than 300 h.",Applied Catalysis B: Environmental
Platinum group metal-free Fe−N−C catalysts for PEM fuel cells derived from nitrogen and sulfur doped synthetic polymers,"© 2022 The Author(s)Fe−N−C electrocatalysts were obtained via pyrolysis of N- or N/S co-doped synthetic polymers impregnated with FeCl3. The influence of the presence/absence of sulfur co-doping, the initial FeCl3 content and phenanthroline addition on the Fe−N−C–based cathode catalyst layers (CCLs) performance in H2-air PEM fuel cells was studied. To this end the Fe−N−C materials were first characterized concerning their chemical composition, surface chemistry, porosity and morphology. Sulfur and phenanthroline additions strongly affect these characteristics of Fe−N−C materials. This in turn determines (to various extents) the electrochemical properties as measured with a rotating ring-disk electrode and upon infusion in the cathode catalyst layer in H2-air PEM fuel cells. While simultaneous sulfur and phenanthroline addition yields Fe−N−C catalysts with high N-content and specific surface area, this does not translate into good electrochemical performance. We discuss the multitude of factors determining the catalysts’ and the final CCLs’ performances and conclude that the specific micro-colloidal morphology of the carbon gel-based materials dominates other Fe−N−C characteristics and determines overall FC performance. The best performing CCL provided peak power density of ∼0.15 W⋅cm−2 in a H2-air PEMFC.",Fuel
"A review on recent applications and future prospects of rare earth oxides in corrosion and thermal barrier coatings, catalysts, tribological, and environmental sectors","© 2022 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.Rare earth oxides (REOs) and metals as an important class of materials have generated global interest in modern technology. Here, eight REOs (R2O3, R = Yb, Er, Sm, Eu, Y, Gd, Dy, and Ce) are identified those are mostly used in diverse chemical and industrial sectors. In this concise review the applications of these REOs in corrosion protection, thermal barrier coating, hydrophobic coating, catalytic reactions, refrigeration, photoactivity, environmental, and tribological sector are briefly summarized, which are sparsely documented in the existing literature review. In what follows, recently published relevant literature is systematically evaluated and key insights are addressed. The use of REOs as nonstoichiometric compounds or as doping agents to enhance the system performance of specific applications is commendable. Related lab-scale studies, therefore, will invoke the potential exploitation of individual or blended REOs for large-scale commercialization. However, phase transformation and high energy consumption in the thermal coating, multi-step fabrication of hydrophobic coating, the building of aromatic pollutants in catalysis, magnetic entropy shift in refrigeration, and photo corrosion are some of the inherent hindrances of these oxides. These issues warrant prompt actions from the scientific community to deliver cost-effective, efficient, and environmentally sustainable applications. Regardless, this review is expected to provide critical insights into REOs for contrasting industrial applications and encourage interested researchers to dig deeper in finding the best strategic solutions to counter prevalent challenges.",Ceramics International
A recyclable photocatalyst Cu2O/Fe3O4@C/Cu nanocomposite for efficient photocatalytic reduction of 4-nitrophenol,"© 2022Photocatalytic process using core–shell nano-catalyst is an efficient, eco-friendly, and cost-effective process for removal or minimize hazard of pollutants in waste water. Herein, a recyclable and robust Cu2O/Fe3O4@C/Cu core–shell nanocomposite with photocatalyst activities is designed based on the synergistic photocatalytic activities of Cu2O and Cu and the magnetic property and stability of Fe3O4@C. The Cu2O/Fe3O4@C/Cu is shown to act as nano-catalyst to almost completely convert 4-Nitrophenol (4-NP) to 4-aminophenol (4-AP) within 3 min by sufficient electrons in the electron-rich region formed under ultraviolet light irradiation. The Cu2O/Fe3O4@C/Cu nanocomposite shows a good stability, reusability and magnetic separation ability after five recycles. In addition, a photocatalytic mechanism of 4-NP reduction over this nanocomposite is proposed, and the roles of each nanocomponent of this nanostructure played in the synergistic enhancing photocatalytic performance via cascade reaction is demonstrated. This work suggests that Cu2O/Fe3O4@C/Cu nanocomposite with high activity, good stability and magnetically recyclability could be applied for the elimination of pollutants in wastewater.",Applied Surface Science
"Doped 2D VX2 (X = S, Se, Te) monolayers as electrocatalysts for ammonia production: A DFT based study","© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Electrocatalytic nitrogen fixation under ambient conditions on vanadium dichalcogenides (VX2) with non-metal dopants has been explored herein. Understanding the interface chemistry, inherent electronic and acute synergistic nature of non-metal dopants on two unique phases of VX2 has been meticulously explored through a scrutiny of several non-metal atoms as catalytic centers. The efficacity of N2 chemisorption and N[sbnd]N bond activation has been implemented as crucial parameters to realize boron and carbon doped VX2 monolayers to be electrocatalytically active for nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR). Detailed investigation on the NRR mechanism brings out the pivotal role of thermodynamic favourability for product formation obtained from Gibbs free energy differences. The charge transfer on N and π-π* orbital hybridization and electron “donor–acceptor” mechanism between the non-metal and N2 has been found to modulate the electrocatalytic barrier for NRR on VX2 monolayers. This study proposes boron doped VS2 as an efficient chemically feasible, earth abundant sustainable electrocatalyst for NRR with an overpotential as low as 0.06 eV.",Applied Surface Science
High-performance intermetallic PtCo oxygen reduction catalyst promoted by molybdenum,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.We report the top-down modification of intermetallic platinum-cobalt (Pt-Co) nanoparticle catalyst with molybdenum (Mo) promoters that significantly enhance its oxygen reduction activity. With an optimized coverage of the Mo promoters, X-ray absorption spectroscopy reveals the cluster-like Mo species effectively weakened the binding affinity of Pt surfaces towards oxygen. The Mo-promoted intermetallic Pt-Co catalyst thus exhibits high ORR mass activity of 0.89 A/mgPt compared to 0.22 A/mgPt and 0.62 A/mgPt for pure Pt and Pt-Co respectively under rotating disk electrode testing conditions. The high ORR activity further enabled the operation of the fuel cell membrane electrodes under low cathode relative humidities with minimal penalties in ionic transport resistance at low current regions. Density functional theory calculations reveal the beneficial role of molybdenum oxide cluster species in lowering the d-band energy surface Pt atoms, particularly at Pt segregated regions with no Pt-Co phase in proximity to induce the strain or ligand effects.",Applied Catalysis B: Environmental
Vacancy defect assisted enhanced nitrogen fixation in boron nitride nanomaterials,"© 2022In this investigation, the possibility of employing hexagonal boron nitride nanomaterials (h-BN) as catalysts for nitrogen reduction has been studied using electronic structure calculations. Specifically the role played by the vacancy defects in the h-BN has been studied for the activation of N2 and synthesis of ammonia. The basic hypothesis considered in this investigation is that the coordinatively unsaturated defective sites are highly reactive due to termination of bonds and they can activate N2 efficiently. Both the charge transfer from h-BN flake to N2 molecule and the elongation of N[sbnd]N bond have been chosen as criteria for the evaluation of nitrogen activation. Results show that the N-vacancy defects with coordinatively unsaturated B-atoms facilitate nitrogen activation. Further, findings have revealed that the high reactivity of the vicinal B-atom (open) of vacancy defect is responsible for the undesirable reduction at BN surface. Hence, partial hydrogenation strategy has been adopted to tune the reactivity of the vacancy defects. Results elucidate that, partial hydrogen efficiently controls the activation process of nitrogen, which in turn reduces the overpotential of NRR from 1.80 to 0.24 V. Comprehensive observations from this study demonstrate that experimental development of h-BN catalysts has immense potential for the activation of N2 and ammonia synthesis.",Applied Surface Science
"Surface functionalization of two-dimensional boridene family: Enhanced stability, tunable electronic property, and high catalytic activity","© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Recently, a two-dimensional (2D) boridene sheet, in the form of molybdenum boride with ordered metal vacancies (Mo4/3B2), has been experimentally realized (Science 2021, 373, 801). The synthesized boridene layer has active surfaces, which offer great feasibility to employ functional groups to modulate the structural, physical, and chemical properties of the materials. Herein, we conduct systematical first-principles calculations to study the structural, mechanical, electronic, and catalytic properties of functionalized boridene sheets M4/3B2Tz (M = Mo, W, Ta, Nb; Tz = O, OH, F). We demonstrate that the surface functional groups can effectively improve the dynamical stabilities of the materials and nine stable configurations were screened out. Among them, Mo4/3B2O2 and W4/3B2O2 sheets are semiconducting with indirect band gaps of 1.07 and 0.81 eV, respectively. While other structures are metallic, some of which possess Dirac points close to the Fermi level. Furthermore, we found a mixture of O and OH terminations can activate the HER performance at the basal plane for all structures. Remarkably, the calculated Gibbs free energy for W4/3B2Tz and Ta4/3B2Tz exhibit near-zero values, which are ideal as HER catalysts. Our work provides theoretical insights of surface functionalization of 2D boridenes for novel electronic and catalytic applications.",Applied Surface Science
High-density Fe single atoms anchored on 2D-Fe2C12 monolayer materials for N2 reduction to NH3 with high activity and selectivity,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Development of high-performance and eco-friendly electrocatalysts for N2 reduction to NH3 is receiving considerable attention. Here the nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) on the newly-reported 2D-Fe2C12 materials has been intensively investigated using density functional theory (DFT). We found that the 2D-Fe2C12 monolayer with atomically dispersed Fe atoms on the same side, denoted as 1s-Fe2C12, possessing high activity and selectivity toward NRR due to the cooperative interaction of two adjacent individual Fe active sites. The NRR channel starting from the bridge-on adsorbed configuration *N-*N has a low onset potential of −0.58 V, and this value could be further reduced to −0.40 V by including the solvation effect. The relatively large energy differences of ∼−0.3 eV for ΔG(*N2)-ΔG(*H) and the almost neutral value for ΔG(*H)-ΔG(*N2→*N-*NH) guarantee the high selectivity for NRR on 1s-Fe2C12. These findings suggest that 1s-Fe2C12 should have great potential for the design of highly efficient electrocatalysts for NRR.",Applied Surface Science
A strain-engineered self-intercalation Ta9Se12 based bifunctional single atom catalyst for oxygen evolution and reduction reactions,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Seeking and designing stable, high-efficiency, and economical bifunctional catalysts for the metal-air battery is challenging but of great significance towards the conversion and storage of renewable energy. In this study, based on first principles calculations, the oxygen evolution (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalytic performance of different transition-metal (TM) atoms embedded into the surface of the self-intercalation structure Ta9Se12 (TM-Ta9Se12) were evaluated. The results demonstrate that the self-intercalated Ta-layer obviously improves the stability and catalytic activity of the system. Remarkably, Pd-Ta9Se12 under a tensile strain of 3 % was identified as an efficient bifunctional catalyst for OER and ORR with overpotentials of 0.65 and 0.42 V, respectively. Mechanistically, the intercalation structure of Ta9Se12 leads to a charge accumulation in the inner layer. But divertingly, under an external force, the charge in the inner layer will diffuse to the surface. This curious phenomenon can provide the possibility for directional and continuous regulation of the catalytic performance of the catalysts. This work elucidates a new approach for designing high-efficient and stable bifunctional SACs for OER and ORR.",Applied Surface Science
Anion complexes of diborane derivatives inserted to benzene,"© 2022 The Authors. International Journal of Quantum Chemistry published by Wiley Periodicals LLC.The complexes formed between three molecules where the diboryl units (HBH2BH) replace the C2H2 moiety in benzene (B6H12, C2B4H10, and C4B2H8) and 10 anions (H−, F−, Cl−, Br−, OH−, CCH−, CH3−, CN−, N3−, and CNO−) have been studied using MP2 computational methods with the complete basis set (CBS) extrapolation scheme. The stability of the complexes for a given anion increases with the number of diborane units in the molecules, and these energy values are correlated with the presence of different anions and number of diborane units. The electron density of the complexes has been characterized and analyzed using the quantum theory of atoms in molecules (QTAIM) and electron density shift (EDS) models.",International Journal of Quantum Chemistry
High productivity of tartronate from electrocatalytic oxidation of high concentration glycerol through facilitating the intermediate conversion,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Selective electro-oxidation of glycerol to value-added chemicals has attracted much attention both for the upgrading of biodiesel industry and the coupled electrolytic hydrogen production. Here we report Pt nanoparticles decorated, Fe- and N co-doped carbon nanotube (Pt/FeNC) catalyst for the selective electro-oxidation of glycerol to tartronate, one of the valuable chemicals used in pharmaceuticals. In a high concentrated glycerol solution of 5.0 M, the Pt/FeNC catalyst reaches the glycerol conversion of 94% and tartronate yield over 47% at 0.9 V vs. RHE, equivalent to a tartronate production rate of 1182 mmol/h/gPt, about 20 times of the highest value ever reported in a batch electrocatalytic reactor. The valence band analysis and kinetic experiments reveal that the FeNC mediates the adsorption behavior of the glycerate intermediate on Pt surface, and promotes the glycerate-to-tartronate oxidation. Moreover, the anchoring effect of FeNC ensures the stable catalytic performance for ten cycles.",Applied Catalysis B: Environmental
Single atom supported on MoS2 as efficient electrocatalysts for the CO2 reduction reaction: A DFT study,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Single-atom catalysts (SACs) demonstrate great potential in electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) which has profound effects in environmental protection and renewable energy. Herein, a series of metal single atoms supported on MoS2 nanolayers (M@MoS2, M = Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Ru, Pd, Pt) is systemically evaluated as CO2RR catalysts by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The results certified that M@MoS2 are selective catalysts for CO2RR to produce CH4. Fe@MoS2, Co@MoS2, Ni@MoS2, and Pt@MoS2 yield a low limiting potential of −0.39 V, −0.24 V, −0.45 V, and −0.50 V, respectively. The binding energy of key intermediates *HCOO is identified as the effective reactivity descriptor to screen the promising CO2RR catalysts for M@MoS2. Moreover, single atom supported on other chalcogenides (MoSe2, WS2, WSe2) also possesses good potential for CO2RR. The current study provides unique insights on working mechanism of SAC in CO2RR and verifies the important tunable effects of two-dimensional materials.",Applied Surface Science
Illumination enabling monoatomic Fe and Pt-based catalysts on NC/TiOx for efficient and stable oxygen reduction,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Although various alloys have been extensively explored to enhance catalyst activity and stability in oxygen reduction, degradation of performance due to long-term operation has plagued the crowd. Here, we develop a catalyst synthesis strategy based on the coexistence of monoatomic Fe and Pt-based clusters/alloys on NC/TiOx. Fe/PtCo-NC/TiOx exhibits a half-wave potential of 0.948 V and mass activity of 3.69 A mgPt−1 at 0.9 V, the latter being approximately 32.1 times higher than that of 20% Pt/C (0.115 A mgPt−1). Additionally, it also shows maximum power densities of 952.2 mW cm−2 and 215.8 mW cm−2 in the H2/O2 fuel cell and Zn-air battery, respectively. The combination of illumination and calcination promotes the electron transfer between Pt and TiOx, thus enhancing the catalytic activity and stability. We also explore the approach and mechanism of using illumination to suppress catalyst performance degradation. The intermittent irradiation inhibits the dissolution of Pt to facilitate the Fe/PtCo-NC/TiOx durability beyond that of most reported metal catalysts, with a half-wave potential degradation of only 14 mV after 30,000 cycles. The ingenious use of illumination provides a simple and feasible strategy for the sustainable utilization of catalysts.",Applied Catalysis B: Environmental
Interfacial electronic structure modulation of CoP nanowires with FeP nanosheets for enhanced hydrogen evolution under alkaline water/seawater electrolytes,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Interface engineering is an effective strategy to regulate surface properties and improve the catalytic activities of materials. Here we develop an interface engineered core-shell structure FeP@CoP catalyst, which only requires 50 mV to realize current density of 10 mA/cm2 with a low Tafel slope of 51.1 mV/dec in 1 M KOH. Density functional theory (DFT) simulations indicate the FeP@CoP interface exhibits optimal H* adsorption energy (0.06 eV) compared with pure-phased CoP (0.26 eV) and pure-phased FeP (−0.18 eV), which is attributed to the significantly electronic structure modulation of Fe and Co atoms at the interface domain. Furthermore, the assembled NiFe LDH@Co3O4/NF||FeP@CoP/NF electrolyzer only demands the voltages of 1.50 and 1.70 V to achieve 10 and 100 mA/cm2 under 1 M KOH. The electrolyzer also exhibits considerable catalytic performance in alkaline seawater electrolyte. What's more, it also can be driven by a commercial Si solar panel under AM 1.5 G 100 mW/cm2 illumination. The regulation of interface-effect paves a novel avenue for constructing high-performance catalysts for hydrogen production.",Applied Catalysis B: Environmental
Mechanistic study on electro-oxidation of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural and water molecules via operando surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy coupled with an Fe3+ probe,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Electrocatalytic oxidation of biomass such as 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) is a green route to produce value-added chemicals. However, in-depth understanding of the electrocatalytic process is still lacking. Herein, the mechanism of HMF electro-oxidation was studied by operando surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) coupled with an Fe3+ probe. A multicomponent platform consisting of titanium plates integrated with a gold film and uniform nickel, cobalt and copper nanoparticles (NPs) was employed as an electrode as well as a SERS substrate, enabling operando SERS study on the electrocatalytic process with simultaneous evaluation on catalytic activity and visualization on the variations of active sites. Fe3+ was intentionally added into the electrolyte as a probe to correlate the nature of active sites with catalytic activity and product selectivity in virtue of its strong interaction with the active sites of the electrocatalysts. Electrodes integrated with Ni and Cu NPs exhibited excellent HMF oxidation performance but their activity were suppressed by adding 1 ppm Fe3+. Conversely, the activity towards water oxidation was significantly enhanced by Fe3+ addition. Fe3+ inhibits the oxidation of Ni2+ to Ni3+ and promotes the formation of more CuO and CuIII. CuIII is better active sites for water oxidation. The presence of Fe3+ also inhibits the transformation of Co3+ to Co4+, but it has no pronounced effects on HMF oxidation performance. A highest 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid yield (94.0%) and a maximum HMF conversion (98%) are obtained from the electrode integrated with Cu NPs at a potential of 1.47 V. HMF oxidation on Cu NPs follows the aldehyde oxidation pathway, which is not affected by Fe3+ addition. This work could afford a feasible route to explore mechanisms of electrocatalytic processes.",Applied Catalysis B: Environmental
Engineering the strong metal support interaction of titanium nitride and ruthenium nanorods for effective hydrogen evolution reaction,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Designing low-cost, high-efficiency hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalysts to break the bottleneck of current electrocatalytic water splitting processes remains a formidable challenge. Here, we report a strong metal-support interaction (SMSI) effect constructed with ruthenium nanorods (Ru NRs) loaded in porous titanium nitride (TiN) nanosheet assembled hollow tube (labeled as Ru NRs/TiN). Ru NRs/TiN exhibits outstanding HER performance in 1.0 M KOH solution, requiring an overpotential of only 25 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm−2, and demonstrates ultra-high mass activity (20 times than that of Pt/C) and superior turnover frequency values with respect to most Ru-based catalysts. Density functional theory calculations show that the SMSI can induce a notable charge redistribution at the Ru-TiN interface and enhance the HER activity of the catalyst. Moreover, the catalyst exhibits excellent stability (10,000 cycles without decay) due to the SMSI effect between the Ru species and the TiN support. Our work has broadened the range of support options for Ru-based catalysts for HER, and provided new insights into the SMSI engineering.",Applied Catalysis B: Environmental
Enhanced oxygen evolution reaction by stacking single-crystalline freestanding SrRuO3,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Single-crystalline transition metal oxide thin film has been employed to perceive the fundamental functions of electronic structure and charge transfer processes in water splitting processes. However, the surface area enlargement and strain tunability in a single-crystalline transition metal oxide are restricted in conventional epitaxy. In this study, we report the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) enhancement by a stack of multilayer SrRuO3 featured single-crystallinity, flexibility, and stackability. The controllable stack of multiple cylindrical SrRuO3 for surface enlargement in a magnitude of order and the emergent electronic structure transition, from t2g(3↑, 1↓) to t2g(3↑)eg(1↑), of Ru efficiently enhances the OER performance, the overpotential can be reduced by ~74 % and ~78 % in KOH and HClO4 respectively at 5 mA/cm2.

Interfacing nickel with molybdenum oxides as monolithic catalyst to accelerate alkaline hydrogen electrocatalysis with robust stability,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Engineering active and robust catalysts for hydrogen evolution and oxidation reactions (HER and HOR) are of importance for the realization of green hydrogen economy. To make catalysts economically competitive for large−scale applications, even−increasing interests have been shifted to designing nonprecious materials for HER and HOR with active and robust performance. Herein, with the guidance of interface engineering, the monolithic catalyst of Ni−MoO2 heterojunctions on nickel foam (Ni−MoO2/NF) was deliberately fabricated by the in−situ corrosion−growth under hydrothermal condition and following thermal−reduction procedure, which exhibits extraordinary HER and HOR performance, for instance, nearly Pt−like catalytic activities, robust long−term durability even under large current density, and superior Faradaic efficiency in alkaline electrolyte. Coupling with the active urea oxidation catalyst of NiMoO4/NF as anode (treating the hydrothermal product in Ar atmosphere), the assembled overall urea splitting electrolyzer with Ni−MoO2/NF as cathode affords the lower voltage of 1.53 V at 20 mA cm−2, and keeps this performance overall 120 h without decay. The systematic physicochemical characterization and electrochemical investigations reveal that the heterointerface-induced charge redistribution, individual electrocatalytic functions, superaerophobic/superhydrophilic electrode surface, and monolithic electrode structure together collaborate to the efficient catalytic activity and stability under larger current density.",Applied Catalysis B: Environmental
Boosting photocatalytic nitrogen reduction to ammonia by dual defective -C[tbnd]N and K-doping sites on graphitic carbon nitride nanorod arrays,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Bi-defective g-C3N4 (K and -C[tbnd]N) nanorod arrays with favorable light absorption through multiple light scattering/reflections were designed for photocatalytic N2 reduction. The highest record of NH3 production, 23.5 mmol/(h·gcat), was achieved when dual defects are present at the nanoarrays without any cocatalysts, which is about two orders higher than its counterpart. The N2 reduction rate is proportional to -C[tbnd]N, unveiling its role as active sites. Its synergistic effect with K was observed. Theoretical calculations support that -C[tbnd]N site is crucial to N2 activation by donating electrons, while cation like K center traps electrons. Consequently, modification with such dual defects in conjunction with nanoarray configuration creates a favorable electron-dominated structure to overcome the energy barrier for activating inert nitrogen, enhancing charge separation and light absorption effectively. The present work underlines the impetus of defects engineering and nanoarray configuration for the rational design of active photocatalysts for efficient N2 fixation.",Applied Catalysis B: Environmental
Fe single-atom catalysts with pre-organized coordination structure for efficient electrochemical nitrate reduction to ammonia,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Single atom catalysts (SAC) have the potential to achieve large-scale production of NH3 through electrochemical nitrate reduction reaction (NO3-RR). Tailoring the coordination structure of the SAC can effectively tune their electronic structure and thus promote their catalytic selectivity and activity. In this work, Fe SAC with unique FeN2O2 coordination was fabricated through direct pyrolysis of metal-organic frameworks that have pre-organized FeN2O4 environment. Fe SAC exhibits both high faradaic efficiency (~92%) and high ammonia yield rate (46 mg h−1 mg cat.−1) in neutral electrolytes. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the O atoms in FeN2O2 can tune the d-band center of Fe and thus adjust the adsorption energies of the NO3-RR intermediates. Compared to FeN4, FeN2O2 structure has higher conductivity and selectivity to NH3 and can spontaneously trigger the transformation of *NOH to N *, thus promoting the NO3-RR. This work provides a simple method to fabricate O, N-coordinated Fe SAC and may stimulate the flourishing development of asymmetric SAC for electrocatalysis.",Applied Catalysis B: Environmental
In-situ growth of ruthenium-based nanostructure on carbon cloth for superior electrocatalytic activity towards HER and OER,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.The control in synthesis and composition plays a vital role in exploring cost-effective efficient electrocatalysts for water splitting. This paper reported a glycerol-assisted solvothermal strategy to synthesize Ru-based electrocatalyst (Ru-G/CC), in-situ growing Ru nanoparticles (NPs) on carbon cloth (CC). The optimal Ru-G/CC exhibits a boosted HER activity (overpotential of 40 mV @ 10 mA cm−2, Tafel slope 76 mV dec−1), surpassing benchmark 20 wt% Pt/C; experimental characterization and DFT calculations verified that Ru NPs with a mixed amorphous/crystalline structure in Ru-G/CC effectively decrease the reaction energy barrier in HER. Also, the hydrothermally derived Ru-H2O/CC-350 exhibited a high electrocatalytic OER activity (overpotential of 270 mV @ 10 mA cm−2, Tafel slope 63 mV dec−1), exceeding the commercial RuO2.

Selective catalytic oxidation of pollutant H2S over Co-decorated hollow N-doped carbon nanofibers for high-performance Li-S batteries,"© 2022Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is one of the most harmful pollutants to human health and the environment. Using carbon-based catalysts, H2S can be selectively oxidized to elemental sulfur (S) at room temperature and carbon-sulfur composites are produced, which enlightens a facile solution combining desulfurization with cathode preparation for high-performance lithium-sulfur batteries (LSBs). Herein, a heterogeneous catalyst of cobalt decorated N-doped hollow carbon nanofibers (Co-NHCFs) is designed for realizing the integrated application, in which the electron redistribution arising from long-range interactions of Co/N-doped carbon significantly promotes the oxygen radical generation and H2S dissociation, leading to its robust catalytic activity for H2S oxidation. Benefiting from the hollow framework with capacious storage space for rapid gas diffusion, the in-situ fabrication of high S-loading carbon-based cathodes (S@Co-NHCFs) used for LSBs is achieved during the H2S oxidation processing. Due to the more favorable diffusion of H2S gas than liquid S, this kind of chemical reaction-induced deposition can realize a more uniform distribution of solid S upon carbon than the traditional method by molten infusion, which, coupled with the catalysis of heterogeneous effect on the reversible sulfur-redox reaction, results in superior electrochemical performance of S@Co-NHCFs in LSBs.",Applied Catalysis B: Environmental
Creation of densely exposed and cavity-edged single Fe active sites for enhanced oxygen electroreduction,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.The performance of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) on Fe-N-C single-atom catalysts (SACs) is still less satisfactory due to the rather low atom-utilization of active sites. Here, a novel acetate thermolysis-assisted route is proposed to create hierarchical carbon nanocages of Fe-N-C SACs (FeSA-N/Cs-OAc) by selective cleavage of carbon layers, which features abundant edge-sited Fe-N4 moieties in well-defined mesoporous channels. Benefiting from the ultra-high site density and utilization of Fe-N4 moieties, the optimized FeSA-N/Cs-OAc catalyst demonstrates excellent ORR activities marked by extraordinarily high half-wave potentials (E1/2) of 0.94 V and 0.82 V in alkaline and acidic electrolytes. Zn-air battery using FeSA-N/Cs-OAc as cathode delivers a power density of 165 mW cm−2, and the maximum output power in H2-O2 fuel cell reaches 640 mW cm−2. The abundant mesoporosity makes most Fe-N4 sites accessible and simultaneously produces in-plane pore defects that reduced adsorption energy of *OH (−0.72 eV), finally presenting remarkably enhanced ORR performance.",Applied Catalysis B: Environmental
Double-active-site enables 2D B2S and B2S3 catalyst with suppressed shuttle effect and improved polysulfides redox kinetics in lithium-sulfur batteries: A first-principles study,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.The sluggish transformation kinetics of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) and the notorious shuttle effect induced by the emergence of highly soluble LiPSs have become the main obstacles preventing the application of lithium-sulfur batteries. The development of bifunctional catalysts capable of accelerating the LiPSs redox kinetics and anchoring these soluble LiPSs is highly desirable for achieving improved cycling performance and Coulombic efficiency. Herein, a two-dimensional B2S/B2S3 catalyst with atomically dispersed boron and sulfur sites was investigated as a potential additive to boost the anchoring of soluble LiPSs and the subsequent LiPSs transformation reaction. Based on first-principles calculations, we demonstrated that the adsorption strengths of soluble LiPSs on B2S/B2S3 monolayers are neither strong nor weak. This effectively inhibits the dissolution of LiPSs while retaining their structural integrity. Importantly, B2S/B2S3 exhibits remarkable catalytic activity toward the liquid-solid (Li2S4 to Li2S2) and solid-solid (Li2S2 to Li2S) reactions in the discharging process as well as the decomposition of Li2S in the charging process. This is crucial for achieving improved rate performance. Moreover, a high Li-ion mass transfer efficiency on B2S and B2S3 was achieved with Ebar values of 0.43 and 0.41 eV, which is beneficial for reducing diffusion-dependent polarization issues. Our results provide an alternative route for developing advanced sulfur cathode catalysts with a suppressed shuttle effect and desirable rate performance.",Applied Surface Science
Surface engineering of superhydrophilic Ni2P@NiFe LDH heterostructure toward efficient water splitting electrocatalysis,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Building heterostructures with rich interfaces by surface engineering is one of the most promising approaches to integrating the rich functionalities for water splitting. Herein, the porous and superhydrophilic nickel phosphide@ NiFe bimetal layered double hydroxides (NF-Ni2P@NiFe LDH) heterostructure in situ grown on nickel foam was successfully constructed. As a result, the unique of self-supported heterostructure and superhydrophilic surface facilitated electron and mass transfer. In addition, the porous structure promoted active site exposure and was in favor of bubble release. Benefiting from the aforementioned advantages, the NF-Ni2P@NiFe LDH performed a superior catalytic performance for water splitting, with a low overpotential of 105.4 mV for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and 203.5 mV for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at 10 mA cm−2, thus a battery voltage of just 1.53 V providing a current density of 10 mA cm−2 at a two-electrode electrolytic cell. Furthermore, the NF-Ni2P@NiFe LDH showed a remarkable stability, which worked for over 60 h at 100 mA cm−2 without visible delay. The ex-situ Raman revealed that the NiOOH and FeOOH severed as active site for OER and HER, respectively.",Applied Surface Science
Structural and interface engineering of Co nanocatalysts induce boosting the electrochemical performance for rechargeable zinc-air battery,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.The development of highly-efficient bi-functional catalysts for Zn-air battery is of importance for sustainable energy-storage field. Rational utilization the integral advantages of metal-organic frameworks and traditional templates is an effective strategy to achieve high performance multi-functional catalysts. Herein, the di-nuclear Co-Zn-MOF was synthesized on the surface of polystyrene (PS) with a facile method, then the porous N, P co-doped carbon encapsulated Co-based catalysts were developed by calcining the PS@Co-Zn-MOF template followed by acid-mist treatment. The characterization results reveal that acid-mist treatment strategy can efficiently modify the surface feature, and remove the surface-adsorbed and unstable metal nanoparticles, thus improving the stability of catalysts. Moreover, this work also proves that low concentration acid-mist treatment can improve the graphitization degree, while high concentration acid can lead to the increase of defective carbon. With this strategy, the obtained Co@PNC-850-0.1H catalyst achieves an impressive enhanced ORR/OER performance, and the potential difference between ORR and OER is only 0.734 V at 0.1 M KOH condition. Additionally, the Co@PNC-850-0.1H based aqueous and all-solid-state Zn-air batteries (ZABs) also deliver excellent performances with extraordinary power density (194.3 mW·cm−2; 70.7 mW·cm−2), high specific capacity (779.7 mAh·g−1@10 mA·cm−2; 723 mAh·g−1@5 mA·cm−2), and ultra-high stability.",Applied Surface Science
Anchored Fe atoms for N[dbnd]O bond activation to boost electrocatalytic nitrate reduction at low concentrations,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Electrocatalytic nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR) is a facile and competitive way to remove NO3--N, but it still faces challenges of cost and reactivity. Herein, we synthesize a single-atom iron electrode (FeSAs/g-C3N4) by a facile one-step pyrolysis method and demonstrate a strategy for N[dbnd]O bond activation with isolated Fe−N4 as the active centre for efficient NO3RR. The catalyst achieved the NO3--N removal capacity of 9857.5 mg N/g Fe, which was the highest among previous studies, and a high faradaic efficiency of 77.3%, even at a low nitrate concentration (50 mg N/L). The designed pathway combined with electrochlorination can completely convert by-products to harmless nitrogen gas. Theoretical research confirmed the contribution of coexisting hydrogen evolution reaction suppression and NO3RR boosted by N[dbnd]O activation on Fe−N4. This work offers a new paradigm for designing the efficient, stable, and energy conservation single-atom cathode for development of NO3--N removal from water bodies.",Applied Catalysis B: Environmental
Size-controlled engineering of cobalt metal catalysts through a coordination effect for oxygen electrocatalysis,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.In the preparation process of carbon-based transition metal catalysts, the transition metal atoms usually seriously agglomerate, thus reducing the catalytic activity. To slow down the agglomeration of transition metal atoms during high-temperature treatments, herein, organics with coordination functions are proposed to regulate the typical metal-organic framework compound ZIF-67 with rich Co atoms. Electron microscopy structural characterization proves that ZIF-67 modified by coordinated organic compounds, including ascorbic acid (AA), citric acid (CA) and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid disodium salt (EA), greatly improves the dispersibility of cobalt in the final product. All the adjusted ZIF-67 can derive cobalt-based bifunctional oxygen catalysts with higher activity. Among them, EA-MOF-Co shows the best ORR performance, with a half-wave potential comparable to commercial Pt/C in alkaline solutions and an obviously reduced oxygen evolution overpotential. This suggests that it is an effective method for use of coordination organics to tether metal ions and prevent their further agglomeration during carbonation.",Applied Catalysis B: Environmental
Two-fold improvement in chemical adsorption ability to achieve effective carbon dioxide electrolysis,"© 2022A strategy of regulating the basicity of perovskite oxygen ions by cation doping is proposed to design cathode materials with high catalytic activity for solid oxide electrolysis cells (SOECs). Specifically, a series of Sr2Fe1.5-xZrxMo0.5O6−δ (SFZxM) perovskites are developed and characterized for its electrocatalytic activity and oxygen ions basicity to investigate the effect on electrochemical performance. The experimental results show that the single cell prepared with the Sr2Fe1.3Zr0.2Mo0.5O6−δ (SFZ2M) cathode reaches a current density of 1.85 A cm−2 at 1.8 V and 800 °C and exhibits good stability over 120 h under CO2 atmosphere. Combined with first-principles calculations, it is further confirmed that the introduction of low-electronegativity ions can improve the oxygen ions basicity and also increase the oxygen vacancy concentration of the cathode, thereby realizing the improvement of electrochemical performance. Thus, this strategy provides new insights into designing electrodes for direct CO2 electrolysis as well as other electrochemical catalysis.",Applied Catalysis B: Environmental
Interfacial construction and lattice distortion-triggered bifunctionality of Mn-NiS/Mn-Ni3S4 for H2 production,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdThe hydrogen is described as a clean and sustainable alternative to fossil fuels in numerous energy systems. Hydrolysis is an important method for high purity, high volume hydrogen production. In order to accelerate the kinetics of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline media, it is essential to explore efficient catalysts. In this paper, the nanoscale self-supported Mn-NiS/Mn-Ni3S4 composite catalysts was assembled on nickel foam. Benefiting from the lattice distortion and vacancy defects caused by the doping of Mn elements, the catalysts exposed an increasing number of electrochemical surfaces and effective active sites, showing impressive electrochemical performance with a HER overpotential of only 94.2 mV at 10 mA/cm2 and an OER overpotential of only 253 mV to drive 50 mA/cm2. Applying as the bifunctional catalysts, the Mn-NiS/Mn-Ni3S4 couple only achieved a low voltage of only 1.52 V to drive 10 mA/cm2. This paper provides new ideas and references for the rational design of high-performance sulfide catalysts with non-precious metal composites.",Fuel
Co-Mo microcolumns decorated with trace Pt for large current density hydrogen generation in alkaline seawater,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Electrolysis in seawater is cost-saving but challenging approach for hydrogen production. In this study, self-supported anticaustic three dimensional (3D) microcolumns anchored with trace Pt clusters on nickel foam (NF) is prepared through solvothermal followed by thermal reduction procedures (Pt-Co-Mo). The as-synthesized electrode owns superhydrophilic and aerophilic surface which favors close contact between the electrode and electrolyte and release of the generated hydrogen bubbles. Besides, the strong synergistic effect between Pt and matrix lead to a significantly improved HER intrinsic activity. Thanks to the above merits, the self-supported Pt-Co-Mo electrode presents outstanding HER activity, which only requires an extremely low overpotentials of 179.2 mV and 194.1 mV to reach a large current density of 2000 mA cm−2 in 1 M KOH and 1 M KOH seawater, respectively. For overall water splitting, cell voltages down to 1.50 V and 1.51 V are necessary to drive 10 mA cm−2 in 1 M KOH and alkaline seawater, respectively.",Applied Catalysis B: Environmental
Molecular trapdoor mechanism of In-SSZ-13(MP) holds promise for selective electrochemical reduction of CO2 at low concentrations,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.The unique molecular trapdoor mechanism of chabazite zeolites provides an ideal platform for CO2 integrative adsorption and conversion. Herein, a mesoporous In-SSZ-13(MP) catalyst was successfully synthesized through desiliconization combined with anchoring uniformly dispersed indium (In) active sites, which achieved the highest formate Faraday efficiency (FEHCOO-) of 92.0 % and a formate partial current density (jHCOO-) of 133.3 mA cm−2 for electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) at a moderate overpotential of 0.8 V. Experimental results combined with DFT calculations reveal the reaction mechanism of In-SSZ-13(MP) electrocatalytic reduction of CO2: as the only channel into the In-SSZ-13(MP) crystal, the gatekeeper (cation, In3+) in eight-membered ring (8MR) deviates from its original position induced by CO2 molecule, then CO2 poured into CHA cage and fully reacted with uniformly distributed indium active sites.",Applied Catalysis B: Environmental
Graphitic carbon layer-encapsulated Co nanoparticles embedded on porous carbonized wood as a self-supported chainmail oxygen electrode for rechargeable Zn-air batteries,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.A self-supported chainmail electrocatalyst is developed by embedding graphitic carbon layer-encapsulated Co nanoparticles on N-doped carbonized wood (Co@NCW) as an advanced air cathode for rechargeable Zn-air batteries (ZABs). The NCW with open aligned microchannels facilitates O2 and electrolyte permeation and transportation, while the uniformly distributed graphitic carbon layer-encapsulated Co nanoparticles on NCW featuring fast electron transfer kinetics provide abundant triphase reaction sites for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The Co@NCW exhibits a half-wave potential of 0.89 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) for ORR outperforming the Pt/C (0.85 V vs. RHE) and an overpotential of 410 mV for the OER (10 mA cm−2) comparable to RuO2 (340 mV). A rechargeable ZAB assembled with Co@NCW presents a power density of 47.5 mW cm−2 and excellent stability at 5 mA cm−2 for 240 h. This work provides an effective strategy to fabricate a practically applicable oxygen electrode for ZABs.",Applied Catalysis B: Environmental
The strain induced synergistic catalysis of FeN4 and MnN3 dual-site catalysts for oxygen reduction in proton- /anion- exchange membrane fuel cells,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.The Fe-N-C single-atom catalysts (SACs) have been widely explored for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in fuel cells. However, how to improve the ORR activity by tailoring the electronic structure of Fe-N-C catalysts is challenging. Herein, we synthesize a Fe-Mn-N-C dual-atom catalyst (DAC) with new local structure of FeN4-MnN3 moiety, and it exhibits ultralow H2O2 yield and better ORR performance than Fe-N-C and Mn-N-C SACs. Importantly, the Fe-Mn-N-C-based proton-/anion- exchange membrane fuel cells present ultrahigh power densities of 1.048 W cm−2 and 1.321 W cm−2, respectively. DFT results reveal that the strain yielded by the formation of Mn-Fe bond significantly optimizes the electronic structure of the Fe-Mn-N-C, and the co-adsorption of the Fe-Mn dual-sites for *OOH not only almost completely suppresses the 2e- ORR, but also breaks the linear correlation between GOH* and GOOH* proposed by Norskov et al., which provides a new route for the design of dual- site catalysts.",Applied Catalysis B: Environmental
Construction of Pd nanoparticles/two-dimensional Co-MOF nanosheets heterojunction for enhanced electrocatalytic hydrodechlorination,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.To simultaneously enhance the catalytic activity of Pd and lower its dosage, we report a Pd/Co-MOF nanosheets/Ni foam electrode (Pd/Co-MNSs/Ni foam) with conductive 2D MOF nanosheets as interlayer for electrocatalytic hydrodechlorination (ECH). Such electrode delivers high ECH activity for nearly complete dechlorination (~97%) of chloramphenicol (CAP) with an apparent rate constant of 0.11 min−1, outcompeting the well-reported and the commercial electrode materials. Pd/Co-MNSs/Ni foam maintains its activity after 9 consecutive runs and 5-day exposure to air, and shows rapid degradation kinetics for other priority contaminants. The formation of Pd/Co-MNSs heterojunction interface increases the electron density of metallic Pd and brings the d states closer to Fermi level than Pd alone, thus optimizing the binding of ECH intermediates. This support construction-based strategy tunes the interface of catalytic electrode to expose active sites and modulate the electronic states of catalyst to promote intrinsic activity, boosting electroreductive remediation of organic halides.",Applied Catalysis B: Environmental
In-situ cobalt-nickel alloy catalyzed nitrogen-doped carbon nanotube arrays as superior freestanding air electrodes for flexible zinc-air and aluminum-air batteries,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.A flexible air electrode with excellent activity and outstanding stability is highly desirable for metal-air batteries. Herein, the rational design of CoNi alloys derived intertwined N-doped carbon nanotube arrays onto carbon cloth (CoNi@NCNTs/CC) is reported, as self-supported air electrodes for flexible zinc-air and aluminum-air batteries. CoNi@NCNTs/CC exhibits a low potential of 1.56 V at 10 mA cm−2 in OER, along with a half-wave potential of 0.82 V in ORR, which is attributed to abundant active sites including CoNi alloys with optimized adsorption energy, Co/Ni-Nx and N-doped CNTs. The well-designed nanotube array construction with substantial channels on carbon cloth facilitates the mass diffusion and electron delivery, and improves mechanical flexibility. Combining excellent activity and promising flexibility, CoNi@NCNTs/CC based liquid- and all-solid-state zinc-air batteries exhibit excellent charge/discharge capability and long-term stability. And the liquid- and all-solid-state aluminum-air batteries deliver promising discharge property with a high open circuit voltage as well as commendable flexibility.",Applied Catalysis B: Environmental
Energy conversion performance of porous ZrTe hybrid derived from chemical transformation of Zr(OH)4,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdNext-generation fuels are produced via electrochemical water splitting technology, and energy conversion processes can be improved by fabricating high-performance oxygen evolution (OER) electrocatalysts. Among all types of electrocatalysts, alternative, cheap, and high-performance OER catalysts are the metal tellurides. Here in the present report, the novel ZrTe has directly grown on carbon cloth (CC) and outperforms OER due to its 3D shell-like structure, high conductivity, and porous nature. Hydrothermal conditions are employed to promote an anion-exchange process that leads to zirconium tellurium nanostructure from synthesized tellurium ions and hydroxide of the zirconium hexagonal nanosheets. The electrochemical measurements are performed using modified electrodes, and are tested in the alkaline environment using cyclic voltammetry (CV), linear sweep voltammetry (LSV), and a constant potential chronoamperometry (CA). The ZrTe/CC resulted in a lower overpotential of 294 mV with a smaller Tafel slope of 71 mV dec−1 and high stability of 45 h towards OER because of its unique shape resulting in large electrochemical active zones and more active sites without any binding agent. Additionally, the present study also validates that ZrTe/CC hybrid is more active towards OER via the density functional theory (DFT) and theoretical calculations, as our findings show that it is possible to produce multi-metal telluride-based materials that can be exceptionally efficient and stable electrocatalyst for OER, and also in future applications.",Fuel
Electrochemical reduction of CO2 on single-atom catalysts anchored on N-terminated TiN (1 1 1): Low overpotential and high selectivity,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.The ever-increasing concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2) in atmosphere has been resulting in disastrous effect on the nature and environment. Among the various methods for the CO2 reduction, the electrochemical reduction of CO2 (e-CO2RR) into fuels is considered to be much more effective. In this work, we find that the single atom catalysts (SACs) (SACs = Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn) can be firmly anchored on the N-terminated TiN(1 1 1) surface because of high binding energies on the basis of density-functional theory calculations. We show that the SACs on the N-terminate of TiN(1 1 1) can greatly reduce the energy barrier for e-CO2RR and improve the selectivity of products. SACs, including Sc, Ti, and V, show a high catalytic performance to produce CH4 with a low limiting potential of 0.68, 0.22, and 0.48 eV, respectively. Both CH4 and CH2O can be obtained on SAC-Ni with the potential-determining step (PDS) of 0.77 eV. SAC-Cu can produce CH4 and CH3OH. Our findings demonstrate that N-terminated surface is suitable for anchoring SACs and the catalytic performance for e-CO2RR, such as overpotential and selectivity, can be optimized by using different transition metals, which provides a great way for the convertion CO2 into fuels.",Applied Surface Science
Preparation of sodium ligninsulfonate functionalized MXene using hexachlorocyclotriphosphazene as linkage and its adsorption applications,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.MXene is a newly emerged two-dimensional material that has been extensively explored for different applications, including as adsorbents for adsorptive removal of environmental pollutants. However, the lack of active adsorption sites will inevitably impede their adsorption performance and surface functionalization is generally required. In this work, a novel MXene-based adsorbent (named as Ti3C2-SL) was fabricated by a simple substitution reaction using hexachlorocyclotriphosphazene (HCCP) as the linkage to conjugate amino groups terminated Ti3C2 and sodium ligninsulfonate. Ti3C2-SL was examined as adsorbent for adsorption of doxorubicin hydrochloride (DOX) and many experiments were performed to evaluate different parameters on the adsorption behaviors. These experimental data were fitted and related parameters were calculated to study the adsorption kinetics and thermodynamics. Results demonstrated that DOX can be rapidly adsorbed by Ti3C2-SL and the adsorption capacity reached a relatively high value within 2 min. The maximum adsorption capacity after equilibrium is up to 190.78 mg g−1, which is about four folds as compared with that of Ti3C2. The adsorption process is a spontaneous endothermic process and dominated by physical adsorption. All the above results suggested that Ti3C2-SL is promising for adsorptive removal environmental pollutants.",Applied Surface Science
Catalytic dissociation of a water molecule on the (1 1 1) surfaces of Pt0.5Ni0.5 bimetal: Density functional theory (DFT) study,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.One of the biggest challenges for the transition towards renewable energy sources today is the development of affordable platinum (Pt) containing bifunctional bimetals as electrode materials for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Recently, the optimal ratio of a bimetal consisting of Pt and nickel (Ni) was studied. This study included the impact of bimetal mixing on the electronic and magnetic properties of the bimetal. However, the catalytic properties of the bimetal have not been studied and compared to that of the pure metals. In this study, spin-polarized density functional theory calculations were employed to investigate the surface properties of Pt0.5Ni0.5 bimetallic surfaces. Relaxation of the surface terminations showed that the 1.5(1 1 1) and 0.5(1 1 1) surface terminations are energetically the most favourable surfaces, while the 2.0(1 1 1) surface termination is energetically the least favourable surface. However, the 2.0(1 1 1) surface termination is energetically more favourable than pure Ni. The adsorption of single water (H2O) molecule onto various (1 1 1) surface terminations (0.0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5 and 2.0) of the bimetallic surfaces was investigated. The H2O molecule was adsorbed onto the atop site in the most stable orientation, namely parallel to the surface (a flat geometry). The d-band centre revealed that the bonding of the H2O molecule on the 0.5(1 1 1) surface termination is stronger than on the pure Pt surface but weaker than on the pure Ni surface. Bond elongation of the OH bonds and an increase in the HOH bond angle were observed in the H2O molecule adsorbed on the 0.5(1 1 1) surface. The results show that the 1.5(1 1 1) surface termination, where the water adsorbs to a Ni atom, could potentially be used as an electrocatalyst for the water-splitting reaction. However, experimental data are needed to confirm these results.",Applied Surface Science
In-situ surface structural reconstruction of NiMoO4 for efficient overall water splitting,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.NiMoO4 is generally considered as stable substrates rather than participating in the catalysis of overall water splitting. However, when NiMoO4 based catalysts applied in alkaline oxidation/reduction conditions, the in-situ formed surface oxide hydroxides/hydroxyls will further simultaneously enhance oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) via such especial surface structural reconstruction. Here self-supported NiMoO4 is constructed by one-step hydrothermal for OER, followed by vapor deposition method, hierarchical catalyst consisting of monocrystalline P-NiMoOx nanorods decorated by CoP-Co2P nanoparticles (denoted as CoPx/P-NiMoOx) is designed for HER. During OER, surface NiMoO4 in-situ transforms into highly active NiOOH. The reconstructed NiOOH/NiMoO4 exhibits outstanding OER performance (overpotentials of 207 and 266 mV at 10 and 100 mA·cm−2). As HER proceeds, electro-reduction promotes dissolution of molybdenum, meanwhile, hydroxyls from dissociated H2O molecules coupled with exposed nickel sites form amorphous hydroxyls layers at surface dissolution sites. The reconstructed amorphous-hydroxyls/CoPx/P-NiMoOx catalyst possesses highly efficient HER activity (overpotentials of 9 and 67 mV at 10 and 100 mA·cm−2). Additionally, the integrating water splitting system requires only 1.55 V to reach 100 mA·cm−2 with excellent stability.",Applied Surface Science
Universal strategy engineering grain boundaries for catalytic oxidative desulfurization,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.The low-coordinated atoms such as edges, single atoms and vacancies have been widely determined as reactive sites for catalytic oxidative desulfurization. However, the grain boundaries (GB) as a favorable atomic configuration has been ignored. In this work, a universal strategy is proposed to engineer grain boundaries into oxides via facile two-step growth. Take the W18O49 nanowires as an example, the engineered GB can work as reactive sites to build stronger interfacial molecular interactions with dibenzothiophene (DBT) due to the low-coordinated W atoms with local electron-rich state, promoting the surface adsorption and activation performance towards DBT. Moreover, the molecular oxygen activation capacity is improved by GB to yield more superoxide radical relative to W18O49. Benefiting from these features, the GB-W18O49 deliver a greatly improved catalytic oxidative desulfurization behavior relative to W18O49 nanowires, in which 97.7% DBT can be removed by GB-W18O49 in 5 h but only 40.4% of W18O49 nanowires.",Applied Catalysis B: Environmental

The introduction of oxygen-terminated Nb2CTx MXenes can effectively regulate the structure of Co−NC and induces a strong interaction between Nb2CTx and Co−NC, promoting H2O2 electrosynthesis via two-electron (2e−) oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) with high selectivity. Moreover, the assembled device with Co−NC/MXenes as cathode enables an accumulated H2O2 concentration of 4.8 wt% even under natural air diffusion. When combined with the dual-cathode system, the device achieves excellent total organic carbon (TOC) removal towards organic dyes (50 mg L−1) and sulfamethoxazole (20 mg L−1). This work provides a direction for the precise construction of 2e− ORR catalysts and expands an emerging application of the dual-cathode technique.",Applied Catalysis B: Environmental
Energy-efficient electrolytic H2 production and high-value added H2-acid-base co-electrosynthesis modes enabled by a Ni2P catalyst in a diaphragm cell,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Reducing the energy consumption and increasing the additional value of water electrolysis to produce H2 is currently a hot research topic. In this work, we introduce two kinds of promising water electrolysis modes in a diaphragm electrolytic cell for H2 production. When considering the energy consumption, a urea-assisted amphoteric water splitting system was built. This system just needs an ultralow voltage of 0.88 V to attain the current density of 10 mA cm−2 with high durability, which leads to a large decrease of energy consumption of 48.55% compared to alkaline water splitting system by the introduction of electrochemical neutralization energy and thermodynamically-favorable urea oxidation reaction. When considering the additional value, a H2-acid-base co-electrosynthesis system was proposed inspired by the chlor-alkali and electrochemical seawater desalination processes. In this system, only K2SO4 electrolytes are needed, and acid-base chemicals and H2 could be generated at a voltage of 2.32 V (10 mA cm−2).",Applied Catalysis B: Environmental

Herein, based on the π-conjugated coordination chemistry, we have developed several conductive MOFs as active oxygen reduction (ORR) electrocatalysts with tunable H2O2 selectivity. Through tailoring the central metal and the first coordination sphere, weakly-electrophilic Cu sites coupled with strongly-oxidized aromatic 2, 3, 6, 7, 10, 11-hexahydroxytriphenylene (HHTP) linkers are of high favor in a two-electron ORR pathway, resulting in an impressive H2O2 selectivity of 95 % and a superior H2O2 yield rate of 792.7 mmol·gcat−1·h−1 during ORR for conductive Cu-HHTP MOF catalysts. By correlative in situ synchrotron radiation XAFS and FTIR spectroscopies, the potential-dependent dynamic-coupling hydroxyl over Cu sites is found to effectively trigger the self-polarization of π-conjugated metal-ligand Cu-O-C centers of Cu-HHTP MOF via shrinking the first Cu-O coordination sphere, realizing fast 2e- ORR kinetics.",Applied Catalysis B: Environmental

Anchoring Ni/NiO heterojunction on freestanding carbon nanofibers for efficient electrochemical water oxidation,"© 2022Rational design of low-cost and efficient electrocatalyst for the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) to replace noble-metal-based catalysts is greatly desired for the large-scale application of water electrocatalysis. And compared with the conventional powdery catalysts, the freestanding electrode architecture is more attractive owing to the enhanced kinetics and stability. In this work, we report an electrospinning-carbonization-post oxidation strategy to develop the freestanding N-doped carbon nanofibers anchored with Ni/NiO nanoparticles (denoted as Ni/NiO-NCNFs) as efficient OER electrocatalyst. In the synthesized Ni/NiO-NCNFs, the conductive ultrathin carbon layer could promote electron transfer and thus improve the electrocatalytic activity. Meanwhile, the ratio between Ni and NiO could be regulated by tuning the oxidation duration, so as to optimize the adsorption energy of intermediates and improve the OER activity. The Ni/NiO-NCNFs prepared with the oxidation time of 3 h exhibit a promising OER activity and long-term operation durability in 0.1 M KOH solution, requiring an overpotential as small as 153 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm−2. Its overpotential is far lower than that of the reported OER catalysts. This work offers an efficient pathway to develop low-cost and highly active freestanding transitional metal-based OER electrocatalyst for potential renewable electrochemical energy conversion.",Journal of Colloid and Interface Science

In this work, we present the rational design and controllable synthesis of nanosized spinel manganese−cobalt oxide strongly coupled with ultrathin Ti3C2Tx MXene nanosheets (MnCo2O4/Ti3C2Tx) through a facile and cost-effective strategy. The effective combination of spinel MnCo2O4 with Ti3C2Tx nanosheets generates a number of attractive structural features with strong synergistic effects, such as highly accessible surface areas, intimate 0D/2D interfacial connection, full exposure of abundant active sites, optimized electronic structure, and excellent electron conductivity, all of which are very desirable for the HER process. Consequently, the resulting MnCo2O4/Ti3C2Tx electrocatalyst possesses an unusual HER ability with a low onset potential of only 51 mV, a small Tafel slope of 79 mV dec−1 and exceptional long-term stability, markedly outperforming the bare MnCo2O4 and Ti3C2Tx electrocatalysts.",Fuel
Oriented construction Cu3P and Ni2P heterojunction to boost overall water splitting,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Development of efficient and earth-abundant bifunctional catalysts towards oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is imperative to overall water splitting. Herein, in-situ vertically grown bimetallic phosphide nanosheets containing abundant Cu3P/Ni2P heterogeneous interfaces are successfully synthesized on Cu foam (marked as Cu3P/Ni2P@CF) as the bifunctional electrocatalyst for both HER and OER. Owing to the synergistic effects of electronic regulation of heterojunction and the hierarchical array structure on 3D substrate, the Cu3P/Ni2P@CF integrated electrode displays the overpotential of 330 mV @ 50 mA cm−2 for OER and 88.1 mV @ 10 mA cm−2 for HER in 1 M KOH. Interestingly, the catalyst –based water electrolyzer only demands a low cell voltage of 1.56 V@10 mA cm−2, exceeding the integrated Pt/C + IrO2 counterpart. Density functional theory (DFT) results further disclose that the charge rearrangement of heterogeneous interface can not only endow the hydrogen binding energy (ΔG*H) approach to zero, but also boost the H2O dissociation and *OH desorption via multi-site synergy for HER. This work provides a valuable approach to construct advanced materials towards overall water splitting.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Borate narrowed band gap of nickel-iron layer double hydroxide to mediate rapid reconstruction kinetics for water oxidation,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Nickel-iron layer double hydroxide (NiFe LDH) is deemed as an attractive pre-catalyst to lower the reaction barrier of oxygen evolution reaction (OER). However, the catalytic efficiency of NiFe LDH is always hampered by the slow and incomplete reconstruction during OER process. Herein, a strategy of borate ion (BO33-) regulation is developed to achieve a fast and adequate reconstruction of NiFe LDH. The BO33- is easy to fill the oxygen vacancy in NiFe LDH, which can narrow the band gap of NiFe LDH to realize an efficient reconstruction under OER conditions. DFT calculations demonstrate the enhanced effect of BO33- on adsorption of hydroxyl ion (OH-) to further improve the OER activity. Sequentially, the BO33- decorated NiFe LDH (NiFeB) shows a desirable catalytic activity for OER with an ultralow overpotential of 201 mV to reach a current density of 10 mA cm−2, which is 40 mV lower than the overpotential of pure NiFe LDH. Moreover, membrane electrode assembly cell using anodic NiFeB and cathodic Pt/C for water splitting affords a cell voltage of only 2.0 V to drive a current density of 540 mA cm−2. This work widens the horizon of ion effect on electrocatalysis and offers an effective approach for developing high-active electrocatalysts.",Applied Catalysis B: Environmental
Ni3P-Ni heterostructure electrocatalyst for alkaline hydrogen evolution,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Highly active and stable electrocatalysts at low cost for hydrogen evolution reaction are essential for large scale hydrogen production.

FeCo nanoalloys encapsulated in pod-like N-doped carbon nanotubes as efficient oxygen reduction reaction electrocatalysts for zinc-air batteries,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.The construction of non-noble metal catalysts with high activity and stability is of great importance for boosting oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) process. Herein, a novel catalyst is developed based on FeCo alloy nanoparticles encapsulated by pod-like N-doped carbon nanotubes in situ grown on carbon black (FeCo@PNCNT-CB). The catalysts are synthesized by a simple chemical vapor deposition (CVD) strategy and the pyrolysis temperature plays a critical impact on the ORR features when FeCo@PNCNT-CB is used as ORR electrocatalysts. The optimized electrocatalysts of FeCo@PNCNT-CB-800 displays a half-wave potential of 0.85 V, which is closed to that of Pt/C in alkaline conditions. Meanwhile, FeCo@PNCNT-CB-800 also delivers a superior stability and methanol tolerance, which is much better than that of commercial Pt/C. Importantly, when FeCo@PNCNT-CB-800 is utilized as a cathode for zinc-air batteries, a high open-circuit potential of 1.506 V, remarkable peak power density of 190.6 mW cm−2, and satisfactory stability are achieved.",Journal of Alloys and Compounds
"Tailoring well-ordered, highly crystalline carbon nitride nanoarrays via molecular engineering for efficient photosynthesis of H2O2","© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Small-scale on-site artificial photosynthesis of H2O2 from O2 and H2O is an ideal sustainable route. In particularly, g-C3N4 is a very popular catalyst, nevertheless, its photocatalytic activity is severely inhibited by the random migration and rapid recombination of photogenerated carriers. Herein, a well-ordered highly-crystalline g-C3N4 nanoarray with conjugated electron donor-acceptor structure (denoted as PDI/CNA) is rationally designed for efficient H2O2 production to imitate the photosynthesis of natural plants. Both experimental and DFT investigations demonstrate that the tailored PDI/CNA effectively improve charges utilization via eliminating deep defect trapping sites, and reduce its Gibbs free energy (ΔG) of rate-determining step (*HOOH→H2O2). As a result, the optimized PDI/CNA exhibits a superior H2O2 production rate of 1605.32 μmol g−1 h−1 and a high apparent quantum yield of 27.18% (λ = 400 nm). This work sheds light on promoting H2O2 photosynthesis by regulating the crystalline structure of g-C3N4 and rationally designing spatially separated redox centers.",Applied Catalysis B: Environmental
Bi/BiFe(oxy)hydroxide for sustainable lattice oxygen-boosted electrocatalysis at a practical high current density,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Lattice oxygen mechanism (LOM) is a promising pathway to circumvent sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER) for efficient water electrolysis. The iron (Fe)-based oxyhydroxide materials for OER catalysts by LOM is well known. However, dissolution of Fe atoms and promoting participation level of lattice oxygen at a practical and extremely high current density (> 1000 mA cm-2 for oxygen generation) should be resolved for high performance and long-term stability. Here, controlling the reduction of synthetic intermediates allowed amorphous BiFe (oxy)hydroxides with secondary bismuth (Bi) metal (BM/BiFeOxHy) heterogeneous structures with abundant lattice vacancies to be obtained. The BM/BiFeOxHy electrode exhibited low overpotential of 232 and 359 mV at a current density of 10 and 1000 mA cm-2, respectively. Moreover, the balanced hybridization of Bi/Fe-O was demonstrated to result in long-term catalytic stability without the dissolution of Fe atoms up to 1000 h at the extremely high current density of 1000 mA cm-2 with negligible degradation. We further showed that the excellent performance of the newly proposed BM/BiFeOxHy electrocatalysts is attributed to the utilization of Fe/Bi-O hybridization, the induced amorphous structure, and increased lattice vacancies, which are systematically demonstrated by the electrochemical and physicochemical analysis and theoretical density functional theory (DFT) calculation.",Applied Catalysis B: Environmental
Efficient electrocatalytic conversion of CO2 to ethanol enabled by imidazolium-functionalized ionomer confined molybdenum phosphide,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.An effective electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction reaction (eCO2RR) requires the discovery of a catalytic system that is highly active and selective for multi-carbon products together with superior CO2 diffusion at a catalyst layer to minimize the reduction barriers. Here, we found a catalytic system that uses molybdenum phosphide (MoP) nanoparticles covered by imidazolium-functionalized ionomer (Im) that promotes CO2 diffusion at the catalyst layer toward the catalyst surface, where CO2 is reduced to ethanol (C2H5OH). The electrochemical results with the MoP-Im co-catalyst show a C2H5OH production Faradaic efficiency and a cathodic energy efficiency of 77.4% and 63.3%, respectively, at a potential as low as − 200 mV vs. RHE. The electrochemical experiments along with our physicochemical characterizations indicate that the Im improves CO2 diffusion and balances water content resulting in a higher CO2-to-water ratio at the catalyst layer and fine-tunes the electronic properties of Mo atoms at the MoP surface. In-situ Raman spectroscopy reveals that a high number of adsorbed *CO intermediates on the surface and a higher binding strength of *CO intermediates on the Mo surface sites in the presence of imidazolium molecules are the main reasons for a superior C-C coupling and thereby the improved C2H5OH formation.",Applied Catalysis B: Environmental

Single platinum atoms implanted 2D lateral anion-intercalated metal hydroxides of Ni2(OH)2(NO3)2 as efficient catalyst for high-yield water splitting,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.In this study, we report new electrocatalysts based on 2D anion-intercalated metal hydroxides of Ni2(OH)2(NO3)2 (2D NiHN) and its derivation caused by the implantation of single platinum atoms (PtSA–2D NiHN). The optimum PtSA−1.73–2D NiHN material having low Pt loading of 1.73 wt% exhibits prospective HER activities with an overpotential (η) of 24 mV at 10 mA cm−2, while the 2D NiNH requires an η of only 280 mV to reach 50 mA cm−2 for OER. The assembly of PtSA−1.73–2D NiHN-based cathode and 2D NiHN-based anode to fabricate a two-electrode electrolyzer of PtSA−1.73–2D NiHN(−)//2D NiHN(+) allows a cell voltage of only 1.45 V at 10 mA cm−2 for overall water splitting, superior to RuO2(+)//Pt/C(−). The device also exhibits prospective long-term stability in 1 M KOH. The achievements suggest that the PtSA−1.73–NiHN and 2D NiHN catalysts are two potential candidates for water splitting application.",Applied Catalysis B: Environmental

Herein, we synthesized oxygen-vacancy-rich CoFe/CoFe2O4 embedded in N-doped hollow carbon spheres (Vo-CoFe/CoFe2O4@NC) through pyrolysis, carbonization, and partial reduction. The synergistic effect of introducing oxygen vacancies into CoFe2O4 and the well-defined heterointerfaces between the CoFe alloy and spinel-type CoFe2O4 moderately controlled the electronic structure and provided abundant active sites for the ORR and OER. Vo-CoFe/CoFe2O4@NC exhibited high ORR activity (half-wave potential: 0.858 V and Tafel slope: 56 mV dec–1) and delivered a low overpotential (360 mV at 10 mA cm−2) for the OER. Moreover, rechargeable ZABs using Vo-CoFe/CoFe2O4@NC as the air cathode revealed excellent open-circuit voltage (1.53 V), good power density (139.5 mW cm−2), and longer cycling durability than the state-of-the-art Pt/C-RuO2.",Chemical Engineering Journal

Ammonia borane (NH3BH3, AB) features a high volumetric and gravimetric density of hydrogen, showing great potential for chemical hydrogen storage. Exploring low-cost and high-efficiency catalysts is an essential prerequisite for hydrogen generation through AB hydrolysis under mild conditions. Herein, with rationally designing Ru/Co metal-organic framework (RuCo-MOF), a series of Co2P nanoparticles doping with low-content Ru embedded in nitrogen-doped carbon supported on graphene oxide (Ru-Co2P@N-C/GO) were synthesized via a one-pot phosphorization process.

Deciphering the active origin for urea oxidation reaction over nitrogen penetrated nickel nanoparticles embedded in carbon nanotubes,"© 2022 Elsevier Inc.Urea electrooxidation with favorable thermodynamic potential is highly anticipated but suffering from sluggish kinetics. Deciphering the activity origin and achieving rational structure design are pivotal for developing highly efficient electrocatalyst for urea oxidation reaction (UOR). Herein, nitrogen penetrated nickel nanoparticles confined in carbon nanotubes (Ni-NCNT) is successfully achieved to drive UOR. Active origin of Ni-NCNT is decoded to be the in-situ generated Ni2+δO(OH)ads according to comprehensive analysis. The electrophilic Ni2+δ and protophilic OHads could targeted capture O and H atoms from urea, respectively, achieving molecule activation and accelerating the subsequent proton coupled electron transfer reactions. Nitrogen penetration is identified to promote prior formation of Ni2+δO(OH)ads and push up the d band center of Ni-NCNT, enhancing urea adsorption and subsequent molecule cleavage reactions. As a result, Ni-NCNT exhibits superior UOR performance.

In this work, novel, well-aligned, self-supported NiS/Ni3S4 heteronanorod arrays deposited on graphitized carbonized wood (GCW) are designed (denoted as NiS/Ni3S4/GCW) and synthesized by a facile hydrothermal sulfidation strategy. Benefitting from the optimized surface hydrophilicity/aerophobicity, enhanced electrical conductivity, and 3D hierarchical directional porous architectures, the NiS/Ni3S4/GCW show excellent activity toward the urea oxidation reaction and hydrogen evolution reaction in alkaline electrolytes. The arrays achieved a low potential of 1.33 V (vs. RHE) and 91 mV (overpotential) at 10 mA cm−2 as well as robust stability for 100 h. Significantly, when employed as anode and cathode simultaneously, the urea electrolyzer constructed by NiS/Ni3S4/GCW catalysts merely requires a low voltage of 1.44 V to drive 10 mA cm−2 with superior stability for 50 h. This work not only demonstrates the application of heterogeneous sulfide for urea-assisted hydrogen production but also provides an effective guideline for using renewable wood for designing efficient catalysts in an economical way.",Journal of Colloid and Interface Science

Bismuth pyrochlores with varying Fe/Co ratio for efficient Multi-functional Catalysis: Structure evolution versus Photo- and Electro-catalytic activities,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Bismuth pyrochlores that the crystal structure tolerates lower site misplacements and higher vacancy concentrations exhibit unique stereo-chemical activity, therefore, the manipulation of the property by structural engineering has driven significant research activity, with the goal of realizing their transformative functional potential. Herein, an excellent platform to investigate the role of the strucutre in tuning catalytic activity is provided by varying Fe/Co ratio in a bismuth niobate pyrochlore oxide. Continuous Co-level from 0 to 100% was ingeniously designed on the basis of special phase diagrams and pryocholore-type pure samples were successfully fabricated by a modified sol–gel auto-combustion method. The effect of structural modulation on dielectric property and multi-functional catalytic activities were studied. Significantly, two opposing strucutral shifts were observed with increasing the Co-level, ascribled to the competition between displacive disorders on the Bi sites and strucutral distortions in the octahedral network. Tunable dielectric relaxation was exhibited by electrical modulus spectroscopy and one additional hidden relaxation process implies an outstanding thermal motion of electrons from variable oxidation states of Fe3+/ Co2+ ions when ionized oxygen vacancy becomes weak. For photocatalysis, the low-level Co showed a best visible-light-responsive photocatalytic activity by means of the RhB-dye decomposition, while the high-level Co exhibited a higher photoinduced current density. For electrocatalysis, the sample that maintains its structure with the coexistence of massive oxygen vacancies and low-spin-state Co2+ present a superior oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity, with a lower OER overpotential (∼300 mV at 10 mA/cm2) and a smaller Tafel slope (∼70 mV/dec). Moreover, the underlying mechanism of the improved performances was analyzed in detail and the new insights were provied for constructing single-phase multi-functioning catalysts.",Chemical Engineering Journal

Water electrolysis is a promising technique used for clean hydrogen generation. Usually, the oxygen-evolution reaction (OER) and urea-oxidation reaction (UOR) processes play a vital role in hydrogen production and pollution control. Herein, we report the fabrication of a three-dimensional (3D) crystalline/amorphous heterostructure NiTe/Ni-S electrocatalyst grown on nickel-foam (NF) via facile two steps (i.e., hydrothermal and electrodeposition) strategy. The synthesized NiTe/Ni-S catalyst exhibits an excellent performance toward the OER with a small overpotential of 216 mV to achieve 10 mA cm−2 current density in 1.0 M KOH. Further, it only requires a small voltage of 1.315 V (vs. the reversible-hydrogen-electrode (RHE)) to drive 10 mA cm−2 current density for UOR in 1 M KOH with 0.33 M urea, and reveals excellent long-term catalytic stability. Moreover, the overall water splitting experiments were conducted in 1 M KOH electrolyte with the NiTe/Ni-S catalyst as an anode and Pt/C as a cathode.

Porous bimetallic cobalt-iron phosphide nanofoam for efficient and stable oxygen evolution catalysis,"© 2022Developing oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts with high activity and long-term stability is critical to achieving efficient hydrogen production from water electrolysis. Herein, a porous bimetallic cobalt-iron phosphide (CoFe-P) nanofoam is synthesized via a novel one-pot glucose-blowing followed by oxidization and then phosphidization process. The CoFe-P nanofoam presents a porous nanostructure which contributes to contact with electrolytes and release of generated gas during electrocatalytic reactions. As OER catalysts in alkaline, the bimetallic porous CoFe-P nanofoam exhibit a lower overpotential (258 mV@10 mA cm−2) as well as outstanding stability (70 h@100 mA cm−2), which surpasses the RuO2 and is comparable to many high-performance Co and Fe-based catalysts. It is demonstrated that the surface of CoFe-P undergo a reconstruction process and form new high active (CoxFe1−x)OOH. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the elevated activity is caused by the bimetal Co and Fe optimizing the d-band center (Ed) energy levels and thus balancing the adsorption–desorption capacities for OER intermediates. This work through constructing porous bimetallic nanofoam offers a feasible strategy to facilitate the reaction activity and prolong the long-term stability of OER.",Journal of Colloid and Interface Science
Constructing Ni-VN interfaces with superior electrocatalytic activity for alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction,"© 2022The promotional effects of inert nitrides for metal catalysts in the electrolysis are rarely reported.

Herein, Mn-doped nickel hydroxide porous nanowire arrays (denoted Mn-Ni(OH)2 PNAs) are rationally developed and evaluated as efficient catalysts for the UOR in an alkaline solution via the in situ electrochemical conversion of NiMn-based metal–organic frameworks. Mn doping can modulate the electronic structural configuration of Ni(OH)2 to significantly increase the electron density and optimize the energy barriers of the CO*/NH2* intermediates of the UOR. Meanwhile, porous nanowire arrays will afford abundant spaces/channels to facilitate active site exposure and electron/mass transfer. As a result, the Mn-Ni(OH)2 PNAs delivered superior UOR performance with a small potential of 1.37 V vs. RHE at 50 mA cm−2, a Tafel slope of 31 mV dec-1, and robust stability.

Fabrication of monodisperse gold-copper nanocubes and AuCu-cuprous sulfide heterodimers by a step-wise polyol reduction,"© 2022 Elsevier Inc.Monodisperse gold-copper nanocubes and AuCu-cuprous sulfide (Cu1.96S) heterodimers were fabricated by a step-wise polyol reduction with the aid of oleylamine and 1-dodecanethiol. The geometric configuration was mediated by simply varying the Cu/Au atomic ratio: Au-Cu cubes with sizes of 6.4 and 4.3 nm were yielded at Cu/Au atomic ratios of 1/3 and 1/1, respectively; while AuCu-Cu1.96S heterodimer, consisting of a AuCu cube of 4.6 nm and a Cu1.96S sphere of 6.3 nm was obtained at Cu/Au atomic ratio of 3/1. Detailed structural analysis on the intermediate products, collected at different intervals during the synthesis, revealed that small-sized Au seeds formed at 423 K, followed by the growth of Cu and Cu1.96S crystals at 473 K. Oleylamine coordinated to Au3+ and Cu2+ and thus mediated the particle size; while 1-dodecanethiol bonded to Au3+ and directed the cubic morphology. Excessive Cu2+, at the Cu/Au atomic ratio of 3/1, interacted with 1-dodecanethiol and formed Cu1.96S spherical particle that epitaxially grew over the AuCu cube, resulting in a heterodimer structure. Due to the enriched surficial Cu atoms and their electronic interactions with Au atoms, Au-Cu nanocubes and AuCu-Cu1.96S heterodimers showed pronounced activities for the catalytic reduction of 4-nitrophenol to 4-aminophenol with NaBH4 at 298 K.",Journal of Colloid and Interface Science

Low coordination states in Co3O4/NiOx heterostructures by atomic layer deposition for enhanced gas detection,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Oxygen vacancy is crucial to modulate the electronic structure and chemical properties of functional materials. However, a general and elegant method that is capable of manipulating the surface defects of materials is still missing. Herein, we propose an efficient strategy based on atomic layer deposition (ALD) to create low coordination atomic states in Co3O4/NiOx heterostructures, which allows for controllable regulation of oxygen vacancies, as well as the electronic and band structure of the materials. Consequently, the sensor device based on optimized Co3O4/NiOx sensing layer exhibits significantly enhanced performance to detect triethylamine (TEA) compared to pristine Co3O4, including lower operating temperature, higher sensitivity and lower limit of detection. Considering the generality of the ALD process, the proposed strategy is expected to be useful to design efficient nanomaterials for surface-oriented applications.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Encapsulation of Co/Co3O4 hetero-nanoparticles within the inner tips of N-doped carbon nanotubes: Engineering Mott-Schottky nanoreactors for efficient bifunctional oxygen electrocalysis toward flexible zinc-air batteries,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.The development of economical, efficient and durable bifunctional electrocatalysts for both oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is of paramount importance for the substantial advancement of flexible and rechargeable metal-air batteries. The delicate manipulation of metal/semiconductor heterointerfaces represents a powerful leverage to boost the electrocatalytic performance due to the Mott-Schottky effect. Herein, we demonstrate a typical Mott-Schottky electrocatalyst by ingeniously encasing Co/Co3O4 hetero-nanoparticles within the inner tips of N-doped carbon nanotubes (abbreviated as Co/Co3O4@N-CNTs hereafter) through a facile and scalable hydrogel-bridged pyrolysis strategy. Experimental and theoretical findings collectively manifest that the spontaneous charge redistribution at the Co/Co3O4 heterointerfaces is essential to promote the charge transfer capability, lower down the reaction barriers for oxygen electrocatalysis, and ultimately boost the intrinsic activities. Accordingly, the well-designed Co/Co3O4@N-CNTs exhibit admirable ORR and OER activities and long-term robustness in KOH medium, exceeding the commercial Pt/C and RuO2 benchmarks, respectively. Furthermore, the Co/Co3O4@N-CNTs-assembled flexible all-solid-state zinc-air battery displays a high power density, remarkable rate capability, excellent rechargeablity and outstanding mechanical flexibility even under severe deformations, predicting the great potentials in diverse next-generation wearable electronic devices. The rationale of the construction of Mott-Schottky heterojunctions may provide an innovative and instructive avenue to design diversified energy nanomaterials.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Plasma-assisted highly dispersed Pt single atoms on Ru nanoclusters electrocatalyst for pH-universal hydrogen evolution,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Exploring highly active and stable electrocatalyst using trace noble metals for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is urgently needed but still challenging. Here, atomically dispersed Pt on ultrafine Ru nanoclusters (∼1.46 nm) loaded by the commercial acetylene black (Acet) support is fabricated by a facile one-step cold-plasma technique. The Pt single atoms on Ru nanoclusters electrocatalyst (Pt0.47-Ru/Acet) with 0.47 wt% content of Pt exhibit an excellent HER activity in all pH, achieving ultralow overpotential of only 17, 28, and 8 mV at 10 mA·cm−2 in 1 M KOH, 0.5 M H2SO4, and 1 M PBS, respectively. And the mass activity of Pt0.47-Ru/Acet catalyst in alkaline is about 5.54 and 2.15 times that of commercial Ru/C and Pt/C catalyst at an overpotential of 100 mV, respectively. Meanwhile, after 8000 CV cycles, there is barely performance decrease for Pt0.47-Ru/Acet, displaying good stability. DFT calculation reveals that the Pt single atoms could effectively regulate the electronic structure of Ru clusters, and reduce the energy barriers of water dissociation (Volmer step) as well as subsequent hydrogen evolution (Heyrovsky step), thus enhancing the alkaline HER performance effectively. This work provides an effective approach to designing a high-performance HER electrocatalyst with the atomic-dimension Pt surface modification.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Tailoring oxygen evolution performances of carbon nitride systems fabricated by electrophoresis through Ag and Au plasma functionalization,"© 2022The strategic interest in the production of green hydrogen by sunlight-activated water splitting has stimulated significant efforts aimed at the implementation of active and cost-effective catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), the overall process bottleneck. Herein, we report on an original fabrication route to OER electrocatalysts based on graphitic carbon nitride. In particular, the target systems were deposited on conductive glass substrates via a simple electrophoretic technique and functionalized with highly dispersed noble metals (Au, Ag or Au + Ag) in low amounts by radio frequency (RF)-sputtering under mild conditions. An advanced material characterization revealed the possibility of tailoring carbon nitride morphology as a function of the used precursor and of achieving a homogeneous spatial distribution of the functionalizing metals. The latter ranged from atomically dispersed (silver), to low-sized nanoaggregates (gold) or partially alloyed core–shell nanoparticles (gold+silver), with an intimate metal-nitride interfacial contact. Functional tests evidenced a remarkable sensitivity to Vis light even at low applied potentials, and photoelectrocatalytic performances directly dependent on the nature of metal species and on the features of the underlying carbon nitride deposit. These evidences, rationalized mainly on the basis of Schottky junctions and the possible concurrence of surface plasmon resonance (SPR), candidate the proposed strategy as a versatile route to cheap and efficient OER electrocatalysts for energy conversion.",Chemical Engineering Journal
Coordination compound-derived Fe4N/Fe3N/Fe/CNT for efficient electrocatalytic oxygen evolution: a facile one-step synthesis in the absence of extra nitrogen source,"© 2022 IOP Publishing Ltd.By annealing an Fe(III)-coordination compound (Fe-CC), [FeCl3(Hbta)2] (Hbta = benzotriazole) in the presence of a carbon nanotube precursor (PCNT) template, an Fe4N/Fe3N/Fe/CNT heterostructure was successfully synthesized without an extra nitrogen source. The decomposition of the Hbta in Fe-CC under high-temperature annealing can produce carbon sheets and reduced graphene oxide (rGO), and the presence of CNTs can alleviate the stacking of the in situ-generated carbon materials. Meanwhile, iron nitride nanoparticles (NPs) can be anchored on the carbon sheets, and the anchoring effect efficiently prevents the agglomeration of NPs and increases the amount of active catalytic sites for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Fe4N/Fe3N/Fe/CNT shows an excellent OER activity with a Tafel slope of 63 mV dec−1 as well as overpotentials of 121 (η 10) and 275 mV (η 100) at 10 and 100 mA cm−2, respectively — far exceeding commercial RuO2 and other catalysts. Density functional theory calculations show that the excellent OER performance of Fe4N/Fe3N/Fe/CNT is associated with the Fe4N/Fe3N heterojunction, which can improve the electron conductivity and boost the electron transfer from N to Fe. The Fe4N/Fe3N/Fe/CNT catalyst exhibits long-term OER activity during 100 h of electrolysis at 20 mA cm−2. This is related to the dual coatings of the in situ-generated thin carbon shell and few-layered rGO on the surface of the iron nitride NPs, which can protect the fast leaching of iron nitride during the OER process. Furthermore, the effects of the annealing temperature, the PCNT template and the heating rate on the calcined products were investigated.",Nanotechnology
In situ precipitated NiCo nanoparticles synergize with metaborate to promote hydrogen evolution and couple with urea oxidation to reduce overall water splitting potential,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdA novel NiCo nanoparticles anchored on Ni(Co)(BO2)2 are constructed via a simple redox reaction of NiCo LDH (layered double hydroxide) with NaBH4 which method avoids the Ni foam deformation caused by high temperature reduction or pyrolysis. The experimental and DFT (density functional theory) investigation reveal metaborate (Ni(Co)(BO2)2) exhibits a stronger water adsorption capacity than that conventional metal LDH, which is conducive to the occurrence of hydrogen adsorption in the next step, while NiCo (ΔGH* is closer to 0) is a more suitable hydrogen reaction site than Ni or Co, this synergistic effect of the two substances greatly promotes Volmer step for HER (hydrogen evolution reaction), thereby fundamentally improving HER. The existence of Co0 helps to generate more Ni0, and Co plays an electronic auxiliary role. The Ni0(Co0)-Ni(Co)(BO2)2/NF catalyst possesses small charge transfer resistance, large electrochemical surface area and good hydrophilicity. The Ni0(Co0)-Ni(Co)(BO2)2/NF catalyst exhibits a great application prospect with an overpotential of only 25 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm−2. Even at a large current density of 100 mA cm−2, the overpotential is 107 mV. At a current density of 10 mA cm−2, the voltages of OER (oxygen evolution reaction) and UOR (urea oxidation reaction) are 1.561 V (vs. RHE) and 1.353 V, respectively. Using Ni0(Co0)-Ni(Co)(BO2)2/NF as a bifunctional catalyst for HER and UOR, only 1.47 V can drive a current density of 10 mA cm−2. It is shown that the catalyst will greatly reduce energy consumption and decompose urea when coupling HER and UOR.",Electrochimica Acta
Hollow Mo2C nanospheres modified B-doped g-C3N4 for high efficient photocatalysts,"© 2022 IOP Publishing Ltd.Although graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) is one of the most promising metal-free semiconductors in the field of photocatalytic hydrogen production, the preparation of efficient g-C3N4-based photocatalysts is still a challenge. Herein, the strategy of element doping and co-catalyst loading are employed to make an effective modification on g-C3N4. The Mo2C hollow nanospheres supported by porous B-C3N4 (B-doped g-C3N4) flakes, namely, B-C3N4/Mo2C photocatalysts are successfully constructed by the ultrasonic self-assembly-calcination approach. The unique Mo2C hollow nanospheres structures increases internal multiple visible light scattering, which facilitates light-harvesting, shortens the transport distance of carriers, and hence reduces the carriers recombination. Impressively, B-C3N4/Mo2C-35 exhibits excellent activity in photocatalytic hydrogen production, affording an H2 production rate up to 1696.4 µmol g−1 h−1, which is higher than B-C3N4/3 wt% Pt photocatalyst. Moreover, the apparent quantum efficiency of B-C3N4/Mo2C-35 at 420 nm is 2.12%. Mechanism studies suggest that this desired photocatalytic performance is attributed to a broader light absorption range, more reactive sites and faster carrier transfer rate than that of pure g-C3N4. This work develops a noble metal-free hollow nanosphere co-catalyst system and proposes new insight into the design of g-C3N4-based composite photocatalysts.",Journal of Physics D: Applied Physics
In-situ reconstructed hollow iridium-cobalt oxide nanosphere for boosting electrocatalytic oxygen evolution in acid,"© 2022Iridium oxide (IrOx)-based materials perform high efficiency and durability for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in acidic environment. Developing highly efficient OER electrocatalysts with low Ir-loading in acid is still a great challenge. Herein, we fabricated a hollow IrCoOx nanosphere via in-situ electrochemistry reconstruction strategy. The developed hollow Ir0.16Co0.84Ox electrocatalyst with low Ir-loading (51.91 μg cm−2) exhibits 71-fold and 42-fold improvement in OER mass activity and TOF value compared with commercial IrO2 (1032.16 vs 14.44 A gIr−1, 0.754 vs 0.018 s−1) in 0.1M HClO4, respectively. Combining with the analysis of the IrCoOx structure, the electrochemical performance reveals that the superior activity ascribes to the favorable hollow structure, the abundant crystalline/amorphous heterostructure in the IrOx-enriched shell and the atomic heterointerfaces between Co and Ir oxides, which increase the electrochemical active area, accelerate the OER kinetics and lower the charge transfer resistance (2.8 Ω cm2). This work is anticipated to aid the design of novel low Ir-loading electrocatalysts with outstanding catalytic activity for water splitting in acidic environments.",Electrochimica Acta
The synergistic effect Pt1-W dual sites as a highly active and durable catalyst for electrochemical methanol oxidation,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdDownsizing precious metal catalysts such as Pt to the atomic level is considered effective and efficient in the catalysis industry. However, Pt single-atom alone cannot catalyze the MOR (methanol oxidation reaction) due to the requirement of Pt ensemble sites to activate C-O bonds. Herein, we report for the first Pt single atom dispersed on dual doped TiO2 (Pt1/ Ti0.8W0.2NxOy) as an effective and durable catalyst towards MOR. It is found that synergy between Pt1-WO3-x dual-active-sites enables the adsorption and dehydrogenation of methanol. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that W-site adsorbs methanol molecule and the synergistic cooperation between Pt1-W dual active sites in Pt1/Ti0.8W0.2NxOy contributes to the high catalytic activity, stability, and selectivity. The Pt1/ Ti0.8W0.2NxOy catalyst displays high MOR performance with a mass activity of 560 mA mg−1Pt at 0.82 V vs. RHE in an alkaline medium. This activity is 9.3 and 1.3 times higher than the corresponding Pt nanoparticle (2 wt% Pt/ Ti0.8W0.2NxOy) and 20% Pt/C catalysts, respectively. The lower Tafel slope (93 mV dec−1) and higher diffusion coefficient (1.5×10−12 cm2/s) indicate MOR is faster on Pt1/Ti0.82W0.18NxOy than the other catalysts. Furthermore, Pt1/ Ti0.8W0.2NxOy oxidizes methanol to formate with 90% selectivity, whereas 2 wt% Pt/Ti0.82W0.18NxOy to formaldehyde with 69% selectivity. Moreover, after 10 h, Pt1/ Ti0.8W0.2NxOy mass activity decayed only by 7.2%. In contrast, 2 wt% Pt/ Ti0.8W0.2NxOy and 20% Pt/C exhibited 23% and 43% of activity losses respectively.",Electrochimica Acta
Gradient boosting algorithm for current-voltage prediction of fuel cells,"© 2022The developed catalyst performs well in a half-cell test, but since the catalyst performance is not completely shown in a single-cell test, single-cell optimization through repeated experiments is essential. This is because single-cell is a complex process system affected by various factors, not just a catalyst evaluation system. To reduce the number of laborious tests, we used a machine learning algorithm to prioritize an alkaline fuel cell's operational factor from types of catalyst to fuel concentration for developing an overall performance prediction model. We selected seventeen input features from more than 80 I-V curves and 8000 data points and established prediction models based on two error-scoring modes (mean absolute error and root mean square error), which focused on operational conditions rather than catalytic characteristics. Both models from the two modes charted the factor importance and predicted the overall fuel cell performance with high R2 values (> 0.95) before experiments.",Electrochimica Acta

Nevertheless, the manipulation of the amorphous phase in metal-based catalysts is so far impractical, and thus their electrocatalytic mechanism yet remains ambiguous. In this review, the latest advances in AMCs are systematically reviewed, covering amorphous-phase engineering strategy, structure manipulation, and amorphization of various material categories for electrocatalysis. Specifically, a series of applications of AMCs in electrocatalysis for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are summarized based on the classification criteria of substances. Finally, we put forward current challenges that have not yet been clarified in the field of AMCs, and propose possible solutions, particularly from the perspective of the evolution of electron microscopy. It is expected to promote the understanding of the amorphization-catalysis relationship and provide a guideline for designing high-performance electrocatalysts.",Journal of Materials Science and Technology
"Porous Fe, N co-doped carbon with high electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction performance in Zn-air battery","© 2022 Elsevier LtdNon-Pt electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reactions (ORR) have been developed using metal and nitrogen co-doped carbon electrocatalysts. However, challenges remain regarding the porosity of the catalyst, distribution of active sites, and the easy aggregation of the metal components. Herein, we report a bottom-up preparation strategy to obtain a porous ethynyl-linked conjugated microporous polymer (CMP) precursor containing triazine units and bipyridine, ensuring high N content and coordination with Fe3+. The Fe doped CMP is then carbonization into a Fe, N co-doped nanoporous carbon material (BPCMP-Fe-800), which can be taken as the electrocatalyst in ORR. BPCMP-Fe-800 catalyst exhibits electrocatalytic performance dominated by 4e− transfer mechanism with the onset potential of 0.97 V, half-wave potential of 0.85 V, and higher kinetic current density of 11.3 mA cm−2 (0.8 V). In addition, when applied as cathode electrocatalyst in zinc-air batteries, BPCMP-Fe-800 displays more competitive power density (179.5 mW cm−2) and specific capacity (790.5 mAh g−1) compared with Pt/C. Our study demonstrates a general and facile approach for porous Fe, N co-doped carbon with the potential as alternatives to Pt catalysts for efficient ORR catalytic performances and provides new insights of multi-atom catalysts for other energy conversion related catalytic reactions.",Carbon
Laser-induced rapid construction of Co/N-doped honeycomb-like carbon networks as oxygen electrocatalyst used in zinc-air batteries,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdMetal-organic frameworks (MOFs) template method is a general strategy for synthesising metal-nitrogen-doped carbon catalysts, especially in oxygen electrocatalysts. However, the traditional heat treatment method that transforms MOFs into carbon material requires high temperature, long preparation time, and a harsh gas environment. Herein, we reported a laser-induced carbonized strategy (LIC) that rapidly converts the MOFs into conductive carbon network structures in milliseconds ambient conditions. Interestingly, through LIC, the ZIF-67 derived Co/N-doped honeycomb-like carbon networks present a better bifunctional electrocatalyst performance than the carbon catalyst treated by the traditional carbonization process. This could ascribe to their high specific surface area (SSA) and unique honeycomb-like opening channel structure, which is beneficial for electrolyte storage and mass transfer process. Furthermore, the effect of precursor MOFs size on the catalytic properties was investigated for the laser-induced derived materials. Finally, to better study practical application, the optimized Co/N-doped honeycomb-like carbon networks as catalytic layer was assembled in zinc-air batteries, endowing long cycling stability (220 h) and high specific capacity (780 mA h g−1). This work provides a cost-effective approach for the rapid construction of electrocatalysts for energy conversion and storage applications.",Carbon

Extensive research about the metal-organic framework (MOF) derived layered double hydroxides (LDH) and carbon-based electrocatalysts have been devoted, despite the exceptional performance in OER, yet the limited exposed active sites remain a challenge. Therefore, we reported a novel heteroatom-doped graphene quantum dots (GQDs) incorporated into MOF-derived NiFe-LDH. Taking advantage of abundant active and edge sites of GQDs and modifying the surface chemistry by chemical doping with foreign atoms, the designed heteroatom-doped GQDs/MOF-derived LDH exhibited superior catalytic performance low overpotential of 251 mV at a current density of 100 mA cm−2 in alkaline media.

The as-obtained Cu@δ-MnO2 cathode shows a high specific capacity of 470 mAh g−1 at 0.1 A g−1 and maintains a higher specific capacity during long-term cycles of up to 300 times. Meanwhile, the first-principles theoretical simulations suggest the easier migration of Zn2+ and more Zn2+ adsorption on Cu@δ-MnO2 cathode. The theoretical and experimental results show that Cu ion implantation may be an effective strategy to improve the device performance of the Mn-based layer-tunnel hybrid cathode.","Physics Letters, Section A: General, Atomic and Solid State Physics"
A general confinement co-assembly strategy enabling cross-dimensional supraspheres for boosting electrochemical performance,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdThe bottom-up assembly utilizing nanocrystals (NCs) as building blocks is a highly anticipated approach to access novel metamaterials. Limited by the library of binary spherical assembly, colloidal components of building blocks are necessarily extended for targeting the desired assembled-superstructure with emergent properties. Here, a generalized approach is presented that carbon nanotubes (CNTs) capped with long-chain hydrocarbon ligands, as creative colloidal components, can be compatibly co-assembled with various NCs into binary supraspheres based on a confinement microemulsion environment. Such cross-dimensional assemblies possess the structural merits of excellent conductivity, abundant voids and high stability, thus synergistically boosting its electrochemical performance.

Herein, we report the rational design and synthesis of a strongly coupled hybrid material comprising of FeZn nanoparticles (FeZn NPs) supported by a three-dimensional carbon conductive network (FeZn NPs@3D-CN) for increased ORR performance. Fe-N-C sites can offer high intrinsic activity owing to the unique bonding and oxygen vacancies, and the carbon conductive network facilitating the exposure to active sites, and increasing electron transport. Because of the synergetic effect of the conductive networks containing Fe-N-C and polyaniline, the catalysts exhibited ORR activity in an alkaline medium via a four-electron transfer process. FeZn NPs@3D-CN exhibited outstanding performance with a limited current density (6.2 mA cm-2), the Tafel slope (81.19 mV dec-1), and stability (23 mV negative shift after 2000 cycles), which were superior to those of 20% Pt/C (5.7 mA cm-2, 75.1 mV dec-1, 36 mV negative shift after 2000 cycles).

N-doped graphene nanoribbons intertwined on 3D graphene skeleton as superior metal-free electrocatalyst for oxygen reduction,"© 2022Increasing the active sites of graphene by forming edge-rich graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) represents a promising pathway for improving the behaviors of metal-free electrocatalyst. N-doped GNRs intertwined on 3D graphene skeleton with aerogel structure (N-GNRs/G) is synthesized by hydrothermal method and subsequent pyrolysis process. In the N-GNRs/G aerogel, 3D graphene acts as the skeleton frame to construct a 3D porous structure, while GNRs with irregular edges expose abundant edge defects which offer doping sites for heteroatoms. Thus, the synergetic effect of GNRs and 3D graphene endows the synthesized N-GNRs/G with tremendous pyridinic-N and graphitic-N active sites towards the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The N-GNRs/G hybrid exhibits excellent ORR catalytic activity, superior stability, and selectivity.

In detailed, the photocatalytic removal efficiencies towards TC and Cr(Ⅵ) were 85.88 % and 93.69 % under the optimal conditions, which was ascribed to the enhanced light-harvesting ability, well transfer and separation efficiency of photo-generated carriers through the unique Z-scheme heterojunction structure.

Greatly enhanced CO2 electrocatalytic reduction performance of Ag2Se nanocatalyst via phase-engineering,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Crystal phase of semiconductor nanocatalysts has a great influence on their catalytic performance. Ag-based nanomaterials are fascinating electrocatalysts for CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) toward CO formation. However, the phase-dependent catalytic behavior of Ag-based electrocatalysts has not been studied so far. Herein, we report a crystal phase-dependent catalytic behavior of Ag2Se nanoparticles based on the successful synthesis of monoclinic (m-Ag2Se) and orthorhombic (o-Ag2Se). Remarkably, m-Ag2Se nanoparticles deliver an enhanced CO Faradic efficiency up to 98.1 % at −0.90 V vs. RHE as well as the long-term stability under an extremely high current density, far exceeding that of o-Ag2Se. Theoretical simulations reveal that m-Ag2Se surface not only facilitates the adsorption and stabilization of *COOH species, but also tends to inhibit HER, thus accounting for the high activity and selectivity for CO formation during CO2RR.

Multi-hierarchical cobalt-based electrocatalyst towards high rate H2 production,"© 2022Herein, a rational design of “cobalt/cobalt oxide/cobalt molybdate/nickel foam” multi-hierarchical tandem type electrocatalyst was achieved, where in situ reduced Co and CoO nanoparticles were dispersed uniformly and stabilized by CoMoO3 cuboids. This novel tandem type structure enables strong hydroxyl adsorption on CoO and moderated hydrogen adsorption on Co and therefore promotes the dissociation of water and the recombination of hydrogen intermediates into molecular hydrogen, respectively, and both act synergistically to catalyze the HER reaction. As a result, the current densities were up to 1.3 A cm−2 at only 173 mV overpotential in 1.0 M KOH and 379 mV in 1.0 M PBS solution, respectively. The high rate H2 production of 4.35 ml min−1 at − 1.18 V (vs. SCE) and the outstanding performance of 10 A lasting for more than 800 h in a MEA electrolyzer both indicate the prospect for the usage in practical.",Applied Catalysis B: Environmental
Robust Pt/TiO2/Ni(OH)2 nanosheet arrays enable outstanding performance for high current density alkaline water electrolysis,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Herein, we developed a novel and simple strategy to construct Pt-decorated TiO2/β-Ni(OH)2 nanosheet arrays that steadily deliver large current densities in alkaline electrolyte. It is of great interest to find that the versatile role of few-layered Ti3C2 endows the unique growth mechanism of Pt/TiO2/β-Ni(OH)2. It is worth noting that the interconnected array electrode exhibits noticeable hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance, achieving ultralow overpotentials of 107, 145 and 184 mV at high current densities of 500, 1000 and 1500 mA cm−2, respectively, which outperforms most reported HER electrocatalysts. It requires only 1.95 V to drive 1000 mA cm−2 towards full water electrolysis along with considerable stability. It is demonstrated for the first time that the synergistic effect of Pt and TiO2/Ni(OH)2 the enhanced HER performance.

Non-equilibrium synthesis of stacking faults-abundant Ru nanoparticles towards electrocatalytic water splitting,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Metallic nanomaterials with multidimensional defects are promising for electrocatalysis, whereas exploring facile approaches to synthesize such materials with peculiar structure remains challenging. Here, we firstly synthesized Ru nanoparticles with abundant stacking faults (SFs) combining ultrafast heating with rapid quenching. The close-packed planes of perfect hexagonal closed-packed partially transform into face-centered cubic in the SFs region. It requires 196 mV and 35 mV to drive hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction under 10 mA/cm2 current density, prominently expedites overall water splitting with 1.51 V in acid. Theoretical calculations demonstrate the performance is originated from synergistic effect of the SFs and induced continuous strain field, among which the dominant compressive strain attenuates crystal field splitting effect of Ru sites, thus enhancing the electron transfer of Ru sites. The excellent inter-orbital p-d transfers determine strong electronic activities for boosting OER performance. This work provides insights for rational design of catalysts with defective structures.",Applied Catalysis B: Environmental

Herein, we successfully constructed unique bifunctional CoN3 catalytic sites atomically dispersed on N-doped graphitic carbon nanosheets (CoSA/NCs), which enable Zn-air batteries with ultrahigh durability for over 6000 cycles (~ 2000 h). The 2D carbon construction and single-atom Co formation were achieved simultaneously in salt-assisted process employing CoCl2. CoCl2 serves as a recyclable template, a pore-making agent, and a catalyst for graphitization, which effectively enables the catalyst with abundant active sites catalyze ORR and OER.

With unparalleled catalytic performance and low production cost, this catalyst paves the way for the potential large-scale application of Zn-air batteries.",Applied Catalysis B: Environmental
Understanding dual-vacancy heterojunction for boosting photocatalytic CO2 reduction with highly selective conversion to CH4,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.The selective reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) as the primary component of greenhouse gas, remains a significant challenge in photocatalysis. Here, we present a novel strategy of preparing highly selective and stable heterostructure photocatalysts, which simultaneously contain oxygen and nitrogen vacancies. Synergistic catalysis effect originated from Nb2O5 with oxygen vacancies and nitrogen-rich vacancies of metal-free catalytic (g-C3N4) substrate leads to excellent photocatalytic reduction performances. The as-prepared photocatalysts exhibit outstanding capacity of selective reduction of CO2 with yields of CH4 16.07 μmol g−1 and CO 0.89 μmol g−1 after 5 cycles. Furthermore, the CO2 reduction mechanism is confirmed through density functional theory (DFT) calculation and in-situ technology in detailing. This indicates that the heterojunction surface has a lower free energy barrier for CO2 reduction compared with the pristine sample surface. This new strategy may exploit a vital application of dual-vacancy heterostructure in environmental catalysis.",Applied Catalysis B: Environmental
The power of multifunctional metal hydrides: A key enabler beyond hydrogen storage,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.The metal-hydrogen interaction and its equilibrium conditions allow for distinct properties in metal hydrides (MHs). Based on these properties, MHs have been found to enable a range of novel technologies from thermal compression to sensors, and catalysis. Ni-MH batteries are currently the main application of hydrides in the market. However, new battery concepts such as Li-MgH2, Mn-MH, and hydride-based solid electrolytes have emerged. Fuel cells based on hydrides have also been proposed to convert the chemical “hydride energy” into electrical energy. Based on their unique thermodynamic properties, MHs are also the basis of new concepts in hydrogen compression, heat pumps, cooling systems, and thermal energy storage. Other important applications, including catalysis and chemical speciation have also been considered owing the chemical properties of hydrides. Sensors and smart mirrors based on the dynamic optical, structural, and electrical properties of MHs have been developed. This review summarizes current state-of-the-art along the multiple applications of MHs and provides recommendations on the future progress required to enable a more widespread adoption of MHs beyond their use as hydrogen storage materials.",Journal of Alloys and Compounds
Dual vacancies induced local polarization electric field for high-performance photocatalytic H2 production,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Charge separation and transfer from bulk to the redox sites of surface limits the photocatalytic process. Herein, we prepared a novel NiSeS cocatalyst with Ni–Se dual vacancies to construct NiSeS/ZnSe heterojunctions. The optimized NiSeS/ZnSe photocatalyst exhibits a high photocatalytic H2-evolution rate of 18.32 mmol g−1 h−1 which is 107.8- and 10.2- fold higher than that of pristine ZnSe and 1% Pt/ZnSe, respectively. A high apparent quantum yield value of 50.77% was achieved at 420 nm. The photocatalytic H2 evolution activity of NiSeS/ZnSe is better than most of the state-of-the-art ZnSe-based photocatalysts. The Ni–Se dual vacancies induce a local polarization electric field, which accelerates the surface charge transfer and reduces the reaction barrier in the photocatalytic process. This work provides a feasible approach to introduce dual vacancies and the surface local polarization over photocatalysts for high-performance photocatalytic H2 production.",Applied Catalysis B: Environmental
Generation of interfacial high-spin manganese intermediates as reactive oxidant during peroxymonosulfate activation mediated by amorphous MnOx supported on polymeric substrate,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.The preparation of transition metal oxides based on traditional hydrothermal and calcination processes for heterogeneous PMS activation in contaminants' abatement has been widely reported. A satisfactory PMS activation efficiency often demands the transition metal oxides with crystallographic structure; however, the preparation processes of crystalline metal oxides require more energy input. Besides, achieving the targeted electron transfer between pollutants and reactive oxygen species (ROS) to overcome the disturbance of the actual water matrix is still challenging. Herein, we immobilized manganese oxides onto polymeric substrates under room temperature by a novel redox method with lower energy consumption. The obtained composite was applied for PMS activation to degrade multiple phenolic pollutants mainly through non-radical pathways. Combining the results of multiple characterizations and 18O isotope-tracer experiments, we proposed that the interfacial high-spin [tbnd]MnIII-peroxy complex was the primary reactive oxidant. Besides, a small portion of [tbnd]MnIII-peroxy complex could further undergo interspecies oxygen-transfer to form [tbnd]MnV-oxo species as the secondary reactive oxidant, resulting in the different manganese reduction products ([tbnd]MnIII/MnIV). The proposed mechanism could explain the average oxidation state of Mn changed after PMS activation. Comparing with the radical-based systems, interfacial reactive manganese intermediates exhibited satisfactory resistance against complex water matrices, such as chloride, bicarbonate, natural organic matter (NOM), and effluent organic matter (EfOM). We believe that this study could inspire novel methods with lower energy consumption to prepare active manganese oxides and provide intriguing mechanistic insights into PMS activation mediated by amorphous manganese oxides.",Applied Catalysis B: Environmental
Br-induced P-poor defective nickel phosphide for highly efficient overall water splitting,"© 2022Development of efficient electrocatalysts requires construction of catalytic surfaces with moderate H adsorption energy. Here, we address this challenge by Br-induced formation of P-poor defective nickel phosphide and show that the H adsorption energy can be optimized by regulating the vacancy concentration. We show that when such defective Ni12P5−xBrx nanoparticles are distributed on the surface of Ni2P nanosheets (Ni12P5−xBrx/Ni2P NS), excellent catalytic activity for water splitting is obtained in alkaline media. Density functional theory computations revealed that Br doping induce the formation of a P-poor nickel phosphide with vacancies, leading to an optimal H adsorption strength with a volcano-type relationship. This is the best reported for a non-precious metal phosphide at present: the overpotential for HER is 18 mV at 10 mA cm−2 and 155 mV for OER. This leads to an exceptionally low cell voltage requirement of only 1.44 V to drive overall water splitting in an alkaline electrolyzer.",Applied Catalysis B: Environmental
Biomass coffee grounds derived nitrogen-doped ultrafine carbon nanoparticles as an efficient electrocatalyst to oxygen reduction reaction,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.A nitrogen-doped carbon-based catalyst (Fe-C-CG) to oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is synthesized by pyrolyzing a precursor from coffee grounds, iron chloride and commercial carbon black in ammonia atmosphere. The coffee grounds are pyrolyzed to carbon particles with diameters about 20 nm with the facilitation of carbon black. The carbon nanoparticles show higher reactive activity with ammonia to achieve the doping of nitrogen atoms to carbon with 3.33 at% of content in Fe-C-CG, which is greater than 0.47 at% in the product from commercial carbon black (Fe-C). Resultantly, the Fe-C-CG exhibits high ORR activity with 0.87 V of half wave potential and 5.48 mA cm−2 of limited diffusion current, which highly surpass the 0.71 V, 4.19 mA cm−2 for Fe-C, and are comparable with 0.86 V and 4.52 mA cm−2 for Pt/C catalyst, respectively. The Zn-air battery assembled with Fe-C-CG delivers 142 mW cm−2 of maximum power density and 774 mAh g−1Zn of specific capacity, and can stably work at 1.212–1.257 V of discharge voltage at 10 mA cm−2.

Deep insight of the influence of Cu valence states in co-catalyst on CO2 photoreduction,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Cu is widely used to prepare high-value products in photocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2PR). The valence state of transition metals usually has a great impact on the catalytic process. However, the research on Cu valence in CO2PR is lack for its complex valence change. In current work, Cux/P25 with stable Cu valence composition in CO2PR is prepared. The results show that Cu is composed of Cu0 and Cu2O, and their proportions change regularly as Cu loading changing, which are linearly related to the selectivity of the corresponding products of CO2PR. Combined with thermodynamic and kinetic analysis, the CO adsorption and activation on the surface of Cu0 and Cu2O are considered to be the key to determine the product of CO2PR, which is further confirmed by DFT calculation. Cu0 and Cu2O are proved to be active site of producing CH4 and CO, respectively. In this case, a reference for the study of highly selectivity Cu based photocatalysts is provided.",Applied Catalysis B: Environmental
Architecting the AuPt alloys for hydrazine oxidation as an anolyte in fuel cell: Comparative analysis of hydrazine splitting and water splitting for energy-saving H2 generation,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Replacing the kinetically sluggish anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with hydrazine (N2H4) oxidation reaction (HzOR) could be the effective approach for achieving energy-saving hydrogen (H2) fuel production in a water electrolyzer system. Thus, developing the efficient HzOR electrocatalysts, combined with the cathodic H2 evolution reaction (HER) is of vital importance for the high-rate H2 fuel generation as well as for the advancement of a N2H4 fuel cell. Herein, we utilized a facile integrated process of pulsed laser irradiation and sonochemical process to synthesize AuPt alloys by the irradiation of laser to a mixture of Au/Pt solution in methanol/DI water in varied proportions. The AuPt alloy plays a key role in the chemisorption of N2H4 on its surface, forming a dative bond involving electrons of the lone pair of nitrogen in N2H4 and empty orbitals of Pt in the alloy, indicating its high intrinsic activity against HzOR. The optimal composition of Au1Pt8 electrode demonstrates outstanding characteristics of HER with an ultralow overpotential of 26 mV at 10 mA cm−2 in alkaline medium while requiring 502 mV to attain 10 mA cm−2 for HzOR in 0.5 M N2H4/1.0 M KOH electrolyte. In addition, the assembled overall N2H4 splitting electrolyzer cell using Au1Pt8 alloys as both anode and cathode requires cell voltage of only ~0.172 V at 10 mA cm−2 with tremendous stability over 10 h, which is much lower than the voltage of 1.773 V required for the overall water splitting electrolyzer. The present study validates the feasibility of AuPt alloys for stimulating N2H4 fuel cells in the future to achieve both electrical energy generation and high-rate H2 fuel production.",Applied Catalysis B: Environmental
Carbon nanoarchitectonics with 3D self-crumpled carbon structures induced by GO-assisted carbonization for enhanced oxygen evolution performance,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.In this paper, a three-dimensional (3D) self-crumpled carbon nanoarchitectonics has been synthesized by GO-assisted carbonization, where GO not only serves as a template but also as a catalyst for carbonization of glucose (GLC). It is revealed that dehydration condensation reaction between -OH of GLC and -COOH of GO induces the anchoring of GLC on the surface of GO under high temperature and acidic environment, and subsequently, the dehydration of GLC produces 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (5-HMF) and epitaxially polymerizes and carbonizes into a two-dimensional carbon along GO sheets. In this step, GO provides both nucleation sites and template for the directional polymerization and carbonization of GLC. Due to the catalytic effect of GO, the activation energy of polymerization of GLC is reduced from 114.0 KJ mol−1 to 89.25 KJ mol−1 after the addition of GO, and the composite is transformed from two-dimensional nanosheets to three-dimensional crumpled structure by the capillary force of water evaporation. Due to the unique graphene-like structure, high conductivity offered by GO after heat treatment and more C-O groups derived from GLC, CG-50 shows good electrocatalytic performance. The overpotential is only 438 mV vs. RHE at the current density of 10 mA cm−2, and the Tafel slope is 102 mV dec−1.",Journal of Alloys and Compounds
Inner relaxations in equiatomic single-phase high-entropy cantor alloy,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.The superior properties of high-entropy multi-functional materials are strongly connected with their atomic heterogeneity through many different local atomic interactions. The detailed element-specific studies on a local scale can provide insight into the primary arrangements of atoms in multicomponent systems and benefit to unravel the role of individual components in certain macroscopic properties of complex compounds. Herein, multi-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy combined with reverse Monte Carlo simulations was used to explore a homogeneity of the local crystallographic ordering and specific structure relaxations of each constituent in the equiatomic single-phase face-centered cubic CrMnFeCoNi high-entropy alloy at room temperature. Within the considered fitting approach, all five elements of the alloy were found to be distributed at the nodes of the fcc lattice without any signatures of the additional phases at the atomic scale and exhibit very close statistically averaged interatomic distances (2.54 – 2.55 Å) with their nearest-neighbors. Enlarged structural displacements were found solely for Cr atoms. The macroscopic magnetic properties probed by conventional magnetometry demonstrate no opening of the hysteresis loops at 5 K and illustrate a complex character of the long-range magnetic order after field-assisted cooling in± 5 T. The observed magnetic behavior is assigned to effects related to structural relaxations of Cr. Besides, the advantages and limitations of the reverse Monte Carlo approach to studies of multicomponent systems like high-entropy alloys are highlighted.",Journal of Alloys and Compounds

However, design of high-performance cathode electrocatalysts is still required to speed up the sluggish kinetics of ORR. In this work, we develop a facile strategy to synthesize hierarchically porous N-doped carbon nanosheet networks with ultrafine encapsulated Fe3C and Fe-Nx for ORR by consideration of thermodynamic (intrinsic and support effect) and kinetic (diffusion effect) parameters. The synthetic process is straightforward and sustainable and the hierarchically porous materials can be synthesized directly starting from raw materials and without any additional template. The as-designed catalyst exhibits excellent ORR catalytic performance in both acidic and basic media with much positive half-wave potential and good stability, which is comparable to commercial Pt/C. The excellent ORR performance may result from highly active Fe-Nx sites and ultrafine encapsulated Fe3C, and the hierarchically porous nanosheet structure for accelerating mass diffusion and increasing exposure of the active site. This work provides a facile strategy for rational design and synthesis of highly active, hierarchically porous non-precious metal electrocatalysts.",Journal of Alloys and Compounds
Enhancing glycerol electrooxidation from synergistic interactions of platinum and transition metal carbides,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.To effectively utilize glycerol as a fuel for electrochemical fuel cells, it is necessary to optimize catalysts for effective C-C bond cleavage and complete oxidation of reaction intermediates to achieve maximum efficiency. The current work showed that the synergistic interactions of platinum (Pt) with transition metal carbide (TMC) substrates, such as tungsten carbide (WC) and tantalum carbide (TaC), fulfilled these criteria. The TMC-supported Pt catalysts showed higher activity and selectivity for complete glycerol oxidation than commercial 10 wt% Pt/C. In-situ FTIR analysis revealed that 5 wt% Pt/WC was the most effective catalyst among those tested for complete glycerol oxidation at 0.9 V vs RHE. In-situ X-ray absorption fine structure characterization and density functional theory calculations provided additional insight into the synergistic interactions for glycerol oxidation over Pt/TMC catalysts.",Applied Catalysis B: Environmental
Spatially confined iron single-atom and potassium ion in carbon nitride toward efficient CO2 reduction,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Artificial photosynthesis is a promising strategy for converting CO2 and H2O into fuels and value-added products, while the low catalytic efficiency greatly restricts its practical applications. Herein, we demonstrated that graphitic carbon nitride with spatially confined Fe single-atom and potassium ion (FeN4/K-g-C3N4) exhibited the high activity and selectivity for photocatalytic CO2 reduction. Specifically, the conversion rates of CO2 into CO could achieve up to 20.00 μmol g−1 h−1 with nearly 100% selectivity, more than 10 times higher performances than pristine g-C3N4. Comprehensive characterizations and theoretical calculations revealed that the single-atom Fe bonded with four N atoms in g-C3N4 intralayer, which serve as the active center for absorption and activation of CO2 molecules. The alkali K ions inserted the g-C3N4 interlayers owing to their suitable diameters, which could effectively promote charge separation and transfer. Synergizing the spatial confinements of Fe single-atoms and K ions in g-C3N4 remarkably promoted the photocatalytic activity and selectivity for CO2 reduction into CO.",Applied Catalysis B: Environmental
Unveiling the nanoalloying modulation on hydrogen evolution activity of ruthenium-based electrocatalysts encapsulated by B/N co-doped graphitic nanotubes,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Efficiency of the electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) strongly depends on their extrinsic physical properties and intrinsic electronic structures. Among various modulation strategies, nanoalloying is an efficient route to regulate the intrinsic activities of HER intermediates. Herein, we develop a facile and universal one-step pyrolyzed method to fabricate bimetallic Ru-based nanoalloy catalysts encapsulated by B/N co-doped graphitic nanotubes (RuM@BCN, M=Ir, Pt, Ag, Co, and Fe) for high-performance alkaline HER. BCN nanotube substrates provide sufficient open channels, porous structures and strong anchoring effect to achieve fast kinetics and high stability. The bimetallic nanoalloying strategy greatly promotes the water dissociation and hydrogen adsorption ability of the electrocatalysts via modulation on their intrinsic electronic structures. Therefore, the as-made RuM@BCN demonstrates varied HER behaviors by alloying metals, in which RuIr@BCN exhibits the highest alkaline HER activity with an overpotential of 23.6 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm−2, outperforming commercial Pt/C.",Applied Catalysis B: Environmental
Water acting as a catalytic promoter for electron-proton transfer in the Pt single atom catalyzed environmental reduction reactions,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Water, which is the host of life, introduces many unusual features into the kinetics and energetics of biological reaction systems catalyzed by enzymes. Single atom catalyst has great potential to mimic biological enzymes in regard to special catalytic sites and high efficiency. Here we report a significant promotion by H2O in the environmental reduction of nitrobenzene on an environmentally friendly humic acid supported Pt single atom catalyst. No nitrobenzene conversion took place when only organic solvents were used while high activity of the catalyst was observed in aqueous mixtures (turnover frequency is as high as 1883 h−1). Experiments and density functional theory calculation show that H2O greatly decreased the energy barrier by enabling a biomimetic electron-proton transfer for the hydrogenation process even on single atom Pt catalyst, and a new reaction pathway with phenyl-λ1-azane as intermediate in the direct hydrogenation of nitrobenzene is proposed.",Applied Catalysis B: Environmental
Valence-modified selenospinels as ampere-current-bearing oxygen evolution catalysts,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Industrial water electrolysis requires highly-active and ampere-current-bearing oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts, but achieving such a large operating current density at low overpotentials in available OER catalysts still remains a grand challenge. Herein, we present a new type of high-valence metal modified selenospinels (Mn-CuCo2Se4) as large-current-density OER catalysts. The optimal Mn-CuCo2Se4 exhibits prominent OER activity with overpotentials of 293 and 345 mV to achieve 500 and 1000 mA cm−2, respectively, and displays large mass activity, high turnover frequency and robust stability in alkaline media. Using in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopies, we observe that a surface active layer of oxyhydroxide-like phase with contracted Co–Co distance was evolved during the OER, which is responsible for the highly-active large-current-density activity. This work may open a new arena for the screening of large-current-density OER catalysts based on the wide variety of spinels compounds.",Applied Catalysis B: Environmental
Design of bimetallic 3D-printed electrocatalysts via galvanic replacement to enhance energy conversion systems,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.3D-printing (also known as additive manufacturing) has recently emerged as an appealing technology to fight against the mainstream use of carbon-based fossil fuels by the large-scale, decentralized, and sustainable manufacturing of 3D-printed electrodes for energy conversion devices. Although promising strides have been made in this area, the tunability and implementation of cost-effective metal-based 3D-printed electrodes is a challenge. Herein, a straightforward method is reported to produce bimetallic 3D-printed electrodes with built-in noble metal catalysts via galvanic replacement. For this goal, a commercially available copper/polylactic acid composite filament has been exploited for the fabrication of Cu-based 3D-printed electrodes (3D-Cu) using fused filament fabrication (FFF) technology. The subsequent electroless deposition of an active noble metal catalyst (viz. Pd) onto the 3D-Cu surface has been carried out via galvanic exchange. A detailed electrochemical study run by scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) has revealed that the resulting bimetallic 3D-PdCu electrode exhibits enhanced capabilities by energy conversion related reactions —hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR)— when compared with the monometallic 3D-Cu counterpart. Thus, this simple functionalization approach provides a custom way for manufacturing functional metal-based 3D-printed electronics harboring noble metal catalysts to improve energy-converting applications on-demand and beyond.",Applied Catalysis B: Environmental
Highly stable and efficient Pt single-atom catalyst for reversible proton-conducting solid oxide cells,"© 2022Reversible proton-conducting solid oxide cells (R-PSOCs) have been proposed to address energy storage and conversion challenges. However, under harsh operating conditions (550 °C ~700 °C containing CO2 and H2O), the application of single-atom catalysts (SACs) in R-PSOCs is challenging due to the migration/agglomeration of isolated atoms and the lack of universal processing techniques for catalyst loading. Here, we firstly report a single-atom customizing strategy to create four-coordinated Pt-O-Ni (4) that selective anchors Pt atoms to the B-site in Pr4Ni3O10+δ. The resultant SAC is thermally stable, controllable, and highly active for oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution reactions, withstanding treatment at 700 °C for 800 h in air, and its electrochemical performance was improved by almost 100%. This work bridges the application gap between SACs and R-PSOCs, are amenable to the large-scale manufacture of stable, efficient, high-loading SACs for industrial applications, which can also be extended to Pd, Ir, Ru, and Fe SACs.",Applied Catalysis B: Environmental
Fabrication of amorphous/polycrystalline CoP@CoB hollow nanochains for efficient hydrogen evolution reaction,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Practices in large-scale hydrolysis hydrogen production requires low-cost non-precious metal catalysts with high-efficiency. In this work, amorphous/polycrystalline CoP@CoB hollow nanochains are in-situ fabricated by applying gas-phase phosphating on CoB nano-chains. As expected, the formation of amorphous/polycrystalline with partially hollow structures and P-doping increased the number of exposed active sites, and altered the electronic structure of Co. As a result, the electron transfer and Hydrogen Evolution Reaction (HER) performance are enhanced. Based on the Kirkendall effect, the fabricated CoP@CoB catalyst generates a current density of 10 mA cm−2 at overpotential of 135 mV, which is much lower than the reported value of 250 mV for amorphous CoB nanoparticles.",Journal of Alloys and Compounds

Herein, we report an electrocatalyst consisting of bimetallic carbide nanoparticles encapsulating by an N-doped carbon (NC) layer deposited on the multilayer Ti3C2Tx (denoted as Ni3Mo3C/Mo2C/Ti3C2Tx/NC) for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) using Ti3C2Tx MXene as a conductively catalytic carrier, polyoxometalates (POM) as a soft template, in which bimetallic carbides interact with hybrid carbon. Profiting from the bimetallic character and multi-aperture structure, the Ni3Mo3C/Mo2C/Ti3C2Tx/NC catalyst represents an overpotential of 99 mV in acidic medium and 98 mV in alkaline medium at 10 mA cm−2 with extended durability for 24 h. The turnover frequency (TOF) at 100 mV overpotential for Ni3Mo3C/Mo2C/Ti3C2Tx/NC electrocatalyst is 0.188 s−1. The remarkable catalytic activity for Ni3Mo3C/Mo2C/Ti3C2Tx/NC electrocatalyst can be attributed to the synergistic effects of bimetallic carbides. In addition, the introduction of Ti3C2Tx MXene further strengthened the conductivity of the catalyst as well as accelerated proton transport. Moreover, the protective effect of the porous carbon layer and the adulteration of the N atom increased the active site, resulting in improved HER properties.

To address the challenges, we elaborately design Ag nanoparticles decorated 3D ordered g-C3N4 assemblies based on a synergistic route of Ag-induced supramolecular tailoring and assembling followed by thermal polymerization. The 3D structural topology of the nano-units for g-C3N4 can be altered from 2D orderly stacked nanosheets to 1D twisty g-C3N4 nanotubes by varying the amount of Ag(I). Moreover, the band structures and nitrogen vacancies can also be well-regulated. As supported by experimental and DFT calculation results, ACNNT-2 demonstrates excellent CO2 adsorption capacity, superior light harvesting ability, efficient charge separation and more localized charge density distribution, which can effectively decrease the energy barrier for COOH* intermediate and boost the CO* desorption, resulting in a superior photocatalytic selectivity. Consequently, in sharp contrast to BCN, the ACNNT-2 manifests a markedly improved CO generation rate of 145.5 μmol g−1h−1 under visible-light irradiation, reflecting an 18-fold enhancement together with a CO selectivity of 89%. This strategy provides a profound insight into the multiscale modulation of g-C3N4 photocatalysts with enhanced efficiency.",Applied Catalysis B: Environmental
Maximally exploiting active sites on Yolk@shell nanoreactor: Nearly 100% PMS activation efficiency and outstanding performance over full pH range in Fenton-like reaction,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.In Fenton-like reaction, peroxymonosulfate (PMS) could be activated by either transition metals or graphitized carbon. These two activation paths had their own advantages and disadvantages. To simultaneously increase the PMS activation efficiency and degradation performance, lower the metal leaching, and improve the environmental adaption; herein, a yolk@shell nanoreactor was designed, where Kirkendall effect induced abundant hollow CoO nanoparticles were encapsulated inside a Co, N atoms co-doped graphitized carbon (Co-N-GC) shell. Because of the full exploitation of active sites on yolk@shell nanoreactor, nearly 100% of PMS activation efficiency was realized and 80.0% of tetracycline (TC) (50 mg/L) was degraded within 40 min. Under the protection of Co-N-GC shell, TC were effectively degraded over the full pH range or in the presence of various inorganic anions, and the leached Co2+ was only 0.462 mg/L even after 5 cycles. This study provided a new vision to improve the Fenton-like reaction using yolk@shell nanoreactor.",Applied Catalysis B: Environmental

Herein, a two-step strategy consisting of cavity confinement and post-adsorption is developed to prepare a nitrogen-doped carbon catalyst co-supported by high-density ZnN4 and CoN4 sites (denoted as ZnCo-NC-II) through metal-organic framework (MOF) engineering. Structural characterization incorporated with density functional theory (DFT) calculation demonstrates that electrons are transferred from Zn (donors) to nearby Co (acceptors) through the conjugated graphene π-bond. The optimized Co d-band center achieves a moderate adsorption strength between O2 and CoN4 active sites. So, the rate-determining step (RDS) for the *OOH formation is accelerated. Therefore, ZnCo-NC-II exhibits a distinguished ORR activity with a half-wave potential (E1/2) of 0.86 and 0.79 V (vs RHE) in alkaline and acid media, respectively. The zinc-air battery built with the ZnCo-NC-II catalyst shows excellent electrochemical performance for an immediate practical application. Our work is conducive to an atomic-level clarification on both the composition and design and thereof the synergistic catalytic mechanism with dual-metal sites.",Applied Catalysis B: Environmental
Single transition metal atom stabilized on double metal carbide MXenes for hydrogen evolution reaction: a density functional theory study,"© 2022 IOP Publishing Ltd.Double metal carbide MXenes have received considerable attention for use in renewable energy storage technologies in recent years. Here, density functional theory calculations were performed to investigate the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performances of double metal carbide MXenes (Cr2TiC2O2 and the Mo2TiC2O2 monolayer (ML) modified by a single transition metal (TM) atom (Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Rh, Pd, Ag, Cd, Ir, Pt, Au, or Hg)). The thermodynamic stabilities of TM adatoms on pristine Cr2TiC2O2 and Mo2TiC2O2 MLs and defective Cr2TiC2O2 and Mo2TiC2O2 MLs with oxygen vacancies (denoted as TM-M′2TiC2O2−δ , where M′ = Cr or Mo) were calculated, and the results indicated that the introduction of oxygen vacancies can increase the stabilities of TM adatoms. The TM modification on the MXenes surface tuned the Gibbs free energy of hydrogen adsorption Δ G H, and the Δ G H values of Au-, Co-Cr2TiC2O2−δ , and Ni-Mo2TiC2O2−δ closed to zero values (0.07, −0.07, and 0.02 eV, respectively). The presence of TM adatoms also changed the reaction mechanism of H2 desorption and reduced the activation barrier for H2 production to improve the catalytic efficiency. Nine TM-M′2TiC2O2−δ systems were found to have both HER activity and a lower H2 desorption reaction barrier than the pristine MXenes. Systematic electronic structure analyses showed that charge rearrangement through TM modification could tune the number of electrons gained by the surface O atom and have an impact on the hydrogen adsorption strength. These results indicated that TM surface modification is an effective method for improving the HER catalytic activity of double TM carbides.",Journal of Physics D: Applied Physics
"Fabrication of g-C3N4/N,Fe co-doped CQDs composites: in situ decoration of g-C3N4 with N-CQDs and Fe and efficient visible-light photocatalytic degradation of tetracycline","© 2022 IOP Publishing Ltd.Herein, for the first time, g-C3N4/N,Fe co-doped carbon quantum dots (CN/N,Fe-CQDs) composites were fabricated by a two-step fabrication route. N,Fe-CQDs were obtained via facile pyrolysis of ammonium ferric citrate. Through thermal condensation of the synthesized N,Fe-CQDs and urea, CN/N,Fe-CQDs composites were successfully fabricated for highly efficient photocatalytic degradation of tetracycline (TC). The optimized CN/N,Fe-CQDs composite obtained the degradation efficiency of 81.0% after 40 min visible-light illumination, and its apparent rate constant was 3.41 times higher than that of pure g-C3N4. The remarkable enhancement of photodegradation activity is mainly attributed to the synergetic effect of N-CQDs and Fe co-decoration in CN/N,Fe-CQDs arising from the incorporation of N,Fe-CQDs into the g-C3N4 matrix, which could increase the specific surface area, wide visible-light absorption range, and accelerate separation and transfer of interfacial charge. The active species capture experiments and electron spin resonance technique testified that ‧O2−, ‧OH, 1O2 and h+ were all involved in the degradation of TC in the photocatalytic process. According to the result of mass spectrometry, TC underwent hydroxylation, demethylation, N-demethylation, deamination, dehydroxylation, ring opening processes, and was ultimately mineralized into CO2 and H2O. This research can provide a new understanding of the roles played by non-metal and metal ions co-doped CQDs in photocatalytic system and open up a new way to develop highly efficient photocatalysts for TC degradation.",Journal of Physics D: Applied Physics
Construction of frustrated Lewis pairs at N and Mo2C double sites boosts efficient electrocatalysts for Li-S batteries,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdThe polysulfide shuttle effect and uncontrollable Li-dendrite growth on Li anode are the major reasons limiting the commercial development of Li-S batteries. Transition metal compounds on the carbon vector on the transition of polysulfides have been widely reported. However, there are few reports on the principle of simultaneous transformation and the effect of double active site spacing. Herein, we are based on the mechanism of the anchoring effect of doped elements on the carbon vector. Molybdenum carbide nanoparticles are mounted onto N-doped carbon nanosheets and coated on commercial separators (Mo2C-NCNS) for modification to satisfy the synchronization of S cathode and Li anode. The uniformly dispersed N element promotes the dispersion, homogenization and micro size regulation of Mo2C nanoparticles by anchoring Mo atoms. At the same time, the Mo2C site adjacent to N forms a spatially frustrated Lewis pairs with it. The reasonable spacing between them promotes the uniform deposition of lithium ions, the rapid transformation of polysulfides and the synchronous synergy between them. Characterization by XPS showed that using carbon as a bridge site further enhanced the strong metal-vector interaction between C3N4 and Mo2C, so as to improve the reaction kinetics. Thus, it has an initial specific capacity of 1186 mAh g−1 at 1C, and after 1000 cycles, 400 mAh g−1 remained, with a decay rate of only 0.06% per cycle. At a current density of 1 mA/cm2, the symmetric cell with Mo2C-NCNS modified separator exhibits steady cyclability over 1500 h, with a small overpotential of 76 mV.",Chemical Engineering Science
Enhancing efficiency of solvent-free oxidation of aromatic alcohols with atmospheric oxygen by POSS-based cationic polymer backbone paired heteropolyanions,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Oxidation is among the most crucial reactions for the production of chemicals and many noble metals are the efficient active centers. The catalysts derived from non-noble metal species are preferred thanks the low cost and earth abundance but suffered from inferior efficiency to noble metal ones. Herein, we demonstrated an unusual effective non-noble metal heterogeneous catalyst for the solvent-free synthesis of aromatic aldehydes from selective O2-mediated oxidation of alcoholic compounds. The target catalyst was prepared by the copolymerization of divinylimidazole dibromide and polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane, followed by loading phosphomolybdenum anions via ion exchange. The catalyst gave high yields of up to 93% towards aldehydes, stable reusability, and extendable substrate scope in transforming aromatic alcohols without any solvent. The high performance comes from the abundant low valence Mo species derived from the strong cation-anion interaction, which promoted the O2 activation to give superoxides (•O2−) as the reactive oxygen species.",Molecular Catalysis
A combinatorial descriptor for volcano relationships of electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction,"© 2022 Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, the Chinese Academy of SciencesThough touted as a potential way to realize clean ammonia synthesis, electrochemical ammonia synthesis is currently limited by its catalytic efficiency. Great effort has been made to find catalysts with improved activity toward electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction (eNRR). Rational screening of catalysts can be facilitated using the volcano relationship between catalytic activity and adsorption energy of an intermediate, namely, the activity descriptor. In this work, we propose ΔG*NH2+ΔG*NNH as a combinatorial descriptor, which shows better predictive power than traditional descriptors using the adsorption free energies of single intermediates. The volcano plots based on the combinatorial descriptor exhibits peak activity fixedly at the descriptor value corresponding to the formation free energy of NH3, regardless of the catalyst types; while the descriptor values correspond to the top activities for eNRR on volcano plots based on single descriptors usually vary with the types of catalysts.",Chinese Journal of Catalysis
Porphyrin-MOF-derived carbon-encapsulated copper as a selective and leaching resistant catalyst for the hydrogenation of nitriles,"© 2022Background: Designing high-selective and low-cost catalysts for the selective hydrogenation of nitriles to high value-added amines is important and challenging. Methods: Herein, a non-noble metal Cu@NC-ZrO2 catalyst was prepared by simple pyrolysis using PCN-222(Cu) MOF as the precursor. Significant findings: Under lower temperature pyrolysis, the small Cu nanoparticles (NPs) and abundant Cu-Nx active sites were uniformly embedded in the N-doped support and the produced catalyst retains the mesoporous structure of PCN-222(Cu), which are beneficial for catalytic performance. The Cu@NC-ZrO2–600 catalyst was found to be economic and efficient for the selective hydrogenation of benzonitrile to benzylamine, and the selectivity and conversion can be up to 100% and 95%, respectively. Moreover, due to the encapsulation of Cu nanoparticles in the support N-doped carbon matrix, this catalyst showed outstanding stability of resistance to leaching.",Journal of the Taiwan Institute of Chemical Engineers

Tuning microstructure and improving the corrosion resistance of a Ti-6Al-3Nb-2Zr-1Mo alloy via solution and aging treatments,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdHerein, the influences of solution-aging treatments on the corrosion behaviors of a wrought Ti-6Al-3Nb-2Zr-1Mo alloy are investigated. The solution-aging treated alloys exhibit a better corrosion performance than the wrought alloy, stemming from the alleviated galvanic corrosion. In artificial seawater, all alloys display a spontaneous passivation behavior, and the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), affected by diffusion and charge-transfer processes, performs as the prominent cathodic reaction. However, in 5 M HCl, the activation-passivation transition occurs, and the cathodic reaction is mainly related to the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) controlled by the Volmer reaction. Furthermore, we illustrate the relevant ORR and HER mechanisms.",Corrosion Science
Theoretical understanding of electrocatalysis beyond thermodynamic analysis,"© 2022 Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, the Chinese Academy of SciencesAs the green and sustainable development of human society highly relies on renewable energy, it has been recognized that electrocatalysis is a key technology to this end. High efficient ways of carbon-neutralization (eCO2RR), reverse artificial nitrogen cycle (RANC), and oxygen chemistry (OER and ORR) all can be driven by electrocatalysis. Advanced theoretical study is an important means to fundamentally understanding electrocatalytic reactions. Herein, we review a few significant issues in theoretical electrocatalysis. First, electrochemical barriers and potential effects are essential for a more accurate description of reaction mechanism and activity. Meanwhile, consideration of competitive reaction path is also one of the important aspects, as novel insights and anomalous volcano trend can be obtained. Finally, a microenvironment exerted by confined space can tune the capacitance of electrochemical interface and (electro)chemical potential of proton, resulting in a possibility to improve reaction activity, which opens a new avenue for design of catalyst.",Chinese Journal of Catalysis
Surface chemistry of MXene quantum dots: Virus mechanism-inspired mini-lab for catalysis,"© 2022 Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, the Chinese Academy of SciencesScientific research is currently more interdisciplinary. Researchers have parsed the surface structure of virus, constructed the interaction model of virus-receptors, offering the clues for studying efficient targeted drugs. Likewise, catalysis is also highly relevant to modern human life. Exploring the surface structure and physicochemical properties of catalysts is of great significance for the design of efficient catalysts. Great progresses have been made for endowing specific physicochemical properties of catalysts through controlling the size of materials and coordination chemistry of active sites, particularly at nanometer scale since Sir John Meurig Thomas and Tao Zhang's early ground-breaking contribution, with casting on a very surface issue. Herein, functional regulation renders the emerging MXene quantum dots (MQDs) excel in contrast to the typical carbon-based quantum dots. In fact, similar to the interaction of virus-receptors model, the surface functional groups decorated MQDs provide a mini-lab to afford a variety of adjustments, involved with the type modification and electronic structure tuning of groups as well as their arrangement, together with the interaction between the groups and active materials/support, ultimately for packaging or designing high-activity catalysts.",Chinese Journal of Catalysis
Locating the cocktail and scaling-relation breaking effects of high-entropy alloy catalysts on the electrocatalytic volcano plot,"© 2022 Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, the Chinese Academy of SciencesHigh entropy alloys (HEAs) have been the star materials in electrocatalysis research in recent years. One of their key features is the greatly increased multiplicity of active sites compared to conventional catalytic materials. This increased multiplicity stimulates a cocktail effect and a scaling-relation breaking effect, and results in improved activity. However, the multiplicity of active sites in HEAs also poses new problems for mechanistic studies. One apparent problem is the inapplicability to HEA catalysts of the currently most popular mechanistic study method, which uses the electrocatalytic theoretical framework (ETF) based on the computational hydrogen electrode (CHE). The ETF uses a single adsorption energy to represent the catalyst, i.e., a catalyst is represented by a ‘point’ in the volcanic relationship. It naturally does not involve the multiplicity of active sites of a catalyst, and hence loses brevity in expressing the cocktail effect and scaling-relation breaking effect in HEA catalysis. This paper attempts to solve this inapplicability. Based on the fact that the adsorption energy distribution of HEAs is close to a normal distribution, the mean and variance of the adsorption energy distribution are introduced as descriptors of the ETF, replacing the original single adsorption energy. A quantitative relationship between the variance and the cocktail and scaling-relation braking effects is established. We believe the method described in this work will make the ETF more effective in mechanistic studies of HEA electrocatalysis.",Chinese Journal of Catalysis
"Surface-enhanced vibrational spectroscopies in electrocatalysis: Fundamentals, challenges, and perspectives","© 2022 Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, the Chinese Academy of SciencesElectrocatalysis offers a promising approach towards chemical synthesis driven by renewable energy. Molecular level understanding of the electrochemical interface remains challenging due to its compositional and structural complexity.

To this end, electrochemical surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) and surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (SEIRAS) thrive as powerful techniques to provide fingerprint information of interfacial species at reaction conditions.

Preparation of hydrophobic three-dimensional hierarchical porous zinc oxide for the promotion of electrochemical CO2 reduction,"© 2022 Elsevier Ltd.The construction of three-dimensional hierarchical porous and hydrophobic-aerophilic interfaces facilitates mass transport and CO2 enrichment by kinetically accelerating the CO2 electrochemical reduction reaction (CO2RR). Inspired by the process of baking bread, in which pores that connect the interior of the bread to its exterior are created, we propose a template-free metal carbonate-porous metal oxide (MC-PMO) strategy to synthesize porous metal oxides with tunable pore size. Using this strategy, a series of porous metal oxides with different morphologies and different metals was successfully developed. Furthermore, the effect of catalyst mass transport on the CO2RR was explored. The porous catalysts with suitable pore size promoted mass transfer, which significantly enhanced the activation and transformation of CO2. In addition, based on a hydrophobic group-modified metal oxide surface (HG-MO) strategy, a hydrophobic-aerophilic interface microenvironment was constructed to reduce the water dissociation activity and effectively inhibit the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). HP-ZnO-500 @ 2-NTL was obtained by modifying hierarchical porous zinc oxide (HP-ZnO-500) with the hydrophobic 2-naphthalenethiol (2-NTL). The hydrophobic surface of HP-ZnO-500 @ 2-NTL was easily enriched with CO2 gas under the influence of the ""plastron effect"", and the surface hydrophobic film stabilized the M-H bond. Thus, HER was suppressed. At - 1.0 V vs. RHE, HP-ZnO-500 @ 2-NTL achieved a faradaic efficiency of CO (FECO) as high as 83.0%, and displayed high catalytic activity in a wide potential range. The ""MC-PMO""strategy and ""HG-MO""strategy reported herein are universal and are expected to guide the further preparation and modification of different metal-based porous metal oxides for sustainable CO2RR.",Journal of CO2 Utilization

Developing a high-performance electrocatalyst is one of the most critical challenges that need to be addressed for the RZAB to fulfill that role. Methods: A Ni(OH)2-CNT-Co3O4/NC catalyst consisting of carbon nanotube (CNT), cobalt oxide, and nitrogen-doped functionalities embedded in a porous carbon framework with two-dimensional Ni(OH)2 nanosheets is reported. Significant findings: The prepared catalytic material, Ni(OH)2-CNT-Co3O4/NC, showed a high limit current density of -6.409 mA cm−2 during the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), surpassing that of the commercial Pt/C (-5.625 mA cm−2). The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) potential for this electrocatalyst also reached 1.653 V at a current density of 10 mA cm−2, which is close to that of the commercial RuO2 and thus showed excellent catalytic activity for the OER. As a bifunctional catalyst in the RZAB, the Ni(OH)2-CNT-Co3O4/NC electrocatalyst exhibited a high power density of 244.5 mW cm−2, and cycled 4500 times at a current density of 10 mA cm−2 while displaying good charge and discharge stability. Based upon these performances, we believe that the Ni(OH)2-CNT-Co3O4/NC catalyst can serve as an excellent bifunctional catalyst in the next-generation RZAB.",Journal of the Taiwan Institute of Chemical Engineers

The Cu2O@CuO nanosheets fabricated as a heterogeneous electrocatalyst are utilized for free enzyme detection of glucose and H2O2 in 0.1 M NaOH, whereby the synergy between the multivalent copper species (I and II) results in an overall improvement of electrocatalytic performance. The in-situ formation of interfacial Cu2O@CuO heterostructure is verified using a high-resolution transmission microscope and X-ray photon electron spectroscopy.

Investigations on molybdenum phosphide surfaces for CO2adsorption and activation,"© 2022 Elsevier Ltd.The activation of CO 2 molecule over a catalyst surface is an imperative step to tackle the depletion of fossil fuels and global warming effects. Here, we present density functional calculations to explore sensitivity of molybdenum phosphide (MoP) surfaces for this purpose. Despite well documented efficacy of MoP as a catalyst for electrochemical hydrogen evolution, the fundamental understanding of their structural and electronic analysis remains incomplete. We consider four types of surfaces, (001), (100), (101) and (110) that have varied distribution pattern of metal atoms (Mo and P) that allowed us to investigate the role of p anions in CO 2 activation. Various adsorption sites over each surface were taken into account, the CO 2 molecule adsorbed over the hcp site of MoP (001) surface adopted bent geometry with elongation of C-O bond length to 1.31 Å with adsorption energy 1.50 eV. The electron localization plots and charge transfer as computed via Density Derived Electrostatic and Chemical (DDEC6) approach provide significant overlap of 0.75 e charge density between adsorbate and adsorbent. The activated CO 2 is investigated in detail through charge density difference plots, Projected Density of states (PDOS) and red shift in the symmetric and antisymmetric stretching frequency. The study provides conclusive evidence for catalytic potential of MoP(001) surface towards CO 2 activation.",Journal of CO2 Utilization
Visible-light-driven carbonylation reaction over palladium supported on spherical-like graphitic carbon nitride,"© 2022Exploring sustainable catalysts for the transition-metal-catalyzed carbonylation and acknowledging the corresponding interior mechanism are of great interest. Herein, palladium supported spherical-like graphitic carbon nitride catalyst (Pd@s-CN) was prepared through a microwave-assisted approach, where s-CN with larger surface area was synthesized via an exfoliation and refluxing method. The spherical-like structure of s-CN can offer abundant space preventing the agglomeration of Pd and creating more active sites for carbonylation reaction. Notably, with iodobenzene as the substrate, Pd@s-CN achieved 92% yield of benzoic acid, and its performance was better than that of PdCl2 and Pd/C catalysts.

Elucidating the structure evolution and reaction mechanism of the Cu-In bimetallic catalysts during CO2RR,"© 2022In-based bimetallic catalysts show great potential to reduce CO2 electrochemically. However, the nature of active sites and reaction mechanisms are not fully understood. This study systematically investigates the role of Cu in the Cu-In bimetallic catalysts during the reaction. The partial current densities of formate and CO show a linear correlation with increased Cu content. CuIn3 shows a total current density of 6.40 mA cm−2 and the highest Faradic efficiency for C1 products of 99.3% at −0.7 V vs RHE. A series of characterizations reveal that the Cu1+ species dope into the In(OH)3 lattice for the Cu-In catalysts, while small CuO nanoparticles also form on the surface of catalyst with high Cu contents. The CuO and Cu1+ species are reduced to metallic Cu0, leading to the formation of the Cu0-In(OH)3 interfacial sites.

Synthesis of a Co-Nx type catalyst derived from the pyrolysis of a covalent triazine-based framework for oxygen reduction reaction,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.The preparation of non-noble metal catalysts with performance in the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) comparable or superior to platinum-based catalysts remains challenging. In the present study, hexaazatriphenylenehexacarbonitrile (HAT-CN), which is rich in both cyano groups and pyrazine units, was used as the precursor and then cyclotrimerized into a covalent triazine-based framework with a macrocyclic structure containing abundant complexation sites for transitional metal ions. Subsequently, a series of non-platinum Co[sbnd]N[sbnd]C type catalysts (HAT-CN-Co/C) were prepared, and then pyrolyzed at different temperatures (700 °C, 800 °C, and 900 °C). The pyrolysis treatment endowed the catalysts with activated Co-Nx sites, large pore sizes and high specific surface areas, which can promote oxygen transfer and accelerate the ORR catalytic process. It is found that the catalyst (HAT-CN-Co/C-800) obtained from pyrolysis at 800 °C possessed the best ORR activity and followed the four- electrons transfer pathway; the onset potential of ORR was determined as 0.972 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), very close to that of Pt/C (0.993 V vs RHE), and the half-wave potential (0.895 V vs RHE) was significantly higher than that of Pt/C (0.859 V vs RHE).

“MoFe cofactor” inspired iron mesh-based MIL-88A(Fe/Mo) for bionic photocatalytic nitrogen fixation,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Biomimetic photocatalytic nitrogen fixation is considered as a potential alternative to the Haber-Bosch method, which is an ideal pathway for nitrogen reduction. The development of efficient bionanocatalysts is a serious challenge in the current field of biomimetic nitrogen fixation. Here, we introduced a second metal in the MIL-88A/Fe mesh by metal doping to build a Mo-doped MIL-88A(Fe/Mo)/Fe mesh biomimetic system. The catalyst is a rod-like structure synthesized in situ by hydrothermal method using iron mesh as the substrate, and its rough surface is favorable for the adsorption of N2. The introduction of Mo provides a two-electron transfer pathway for the reaction, and the formation of the ""MoFe cofactor"" effectively promotes charge separation and inhibits the photoelectron-hole complexation. In addition, we kept the catalyst above the liquid surface and provided the proton source through water vapor, which solved the problem of the low solubility of N2 in water and poor mass transfer efficiency. The results show that the biomimetic photocatalyst has good photoresponsiveness in the whole visible region, and the synergistic effect between the two metals makes the MIL-88A (Fe/Mo0.017)/Fe mesh exhibit better photocatalytic performance, and its nitrogen fixation efficiency reaches about 9.6 times that of the original MIL-88A/Fe mesh. This study provides a new idea for the design of photocatalytic ammonia biomimetic photocatalysts.",Molecular Catalysis

In this scenario the environmental problems in the forefront of research priorities. Development of renewable energy resources particularly the efficient conversion of solar light to sustainable energy is crucial in addressing environmental problems. In this regard, the synthesis of semiconductors-based photocatalysts has emerged as an effective tool for different photocatalytic applications and environmental remediation. Among different photocatalyst options available, graphene and graphene derivatives such as, graphene oxide (GO), highly reduced graphene oxide (HRG), and doped graphene (N, S, P, B-HRG) have become rising stars on the horizon of semiconductors-based photocatalytic applications. Graphene is a single layer of graphite consisting of a unique planar structure, high conductivity, greater electron mobility, and significantly very high specific surface area. Besides, the recent advancements in synthetic approaches have led to the cost-effective production of graphene-based materials on a large-scale. Therefore, graphene-based materials have gained considerable recognition for the production of semiconducting photocatalysts involving other semiconducting materials. The graphene-based semiconductors photocatalysts surpasses electron-holes pairs recombination rate and lowers the energy band gap by tailoring the valence band (VB) and conduction band (CB) leading to the enhanced photocatalytic performance of hybrid photocatalysts.

"Silver nanoparticles decorated N-rGO, and NS-rGO nano-hybrids as SERS sensors for hazardous material detection","© 2022 Elsevier B.V.We design and synthesize nanohybrids composed of Silver nanoparticle (AgNPs) with Nitrogen doped (N-rGO) and Nitrogen-Sulphur co-doped (NS-rGO) with GO, SERS probes for the detection of hazardous materials. Graphene oxide (GO) was synthesized using Hummer's method, subsequently N-rGO and NS-rGO were achieved by hydrothermal treatment. GO showed sheet structure with partly folds and N-rGO and NS-rGO maintain ultrathin-layered structure even after doping with N and S molecules. The ID/IG ratio of N-rGO and NS-rGO composites were higher than neat GO, indicating incorporation of defects by replacing sp2 C atoms by N and S atoms. The N-rGO and NS-rGO were further decorated with AgNPs by wet chemical route. Thereafter, nano-hybrids, Ag-N-rGO and Ag-NS-rGO were used as SERS probes for the detection of DNT, PA and DPA molecules. The unique properties of hybrid SERS substrate enables it to achieve nM LOD with excellent reproducibility and five orders of enhancement in Raman intensity.",Sensors and Actuators A: Physical
Construction of CoP/TiO2 nanoarray for enhanced electrochemical nitrate reduction to ammonia,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdElectrochemical nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR) affords a promising approach for maintaining the balance of the global nitrogen cycle while realizing a sustainable route of ambient ammonia synthesis. Herein, it is evidenced that the electrocatalytic NO3RR activity of CoP can be effectively enhanced by constructing a p-n heterojunction of CoP/TiO2 nanoarray on titanium plate (CoP/TiO2@TP). The p-n heterojunction formed in CoP/TiO2 can establish a built-in electric field due to the difference in their Fermi levels, further accelerating the electrons transport. Benefiting from the interactions of heterostructure, such CoP/TiO2@TP attains an excellent Faradaic efficiency of 95.0% and a large NH3 yield as high as 499.8 μmol h−1 cm−2, which is superior to CoP@TP and TiO2@TP. Moreover, theoretical calculations further reveal that the p-n heterostructure can induce charge redistribution of CoP and TiO2, and optimize the adsorptive free energy of intermediates.",Materials Today Physics
Ultrafine cobalt oxide nanosheets for enhanced high activity towards oxygen evolution reaction,"© 2022Cobalt oxide (CoO) nanosheets with a size of about 2.7 nm are prepared. The proper annealing temperatures (200 °C–400 °C) are used to control the conversion of CoO nanosheets to high-ratio hexagonal phases from high-ratio cubic phases at room temperature. The analysis revealed the hexagonal phase is preferable to cubic phase for oxygen evolution reaction of CoO nanosheets. The ultrafine CoO nanosheets with high-ratio hexagonal phases showed a particularly high mass activity of 5597Ag−1 at 1.615 V, 22.8 times higher than that of the noble metal Ru cluster electrocatalyst. Our study indicates an effective way to synthesize nanosheet catalysts with high mass activity.",Catalysis Communications
The effect of tungsten (W) concentration and sulfuration on morphology and optical properties and tuning of the band gap of 2D-MoS2 thin films,"© 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.In this study, two dimensions of MoS2:W thin films were deposited by spray pyrolysis on a glass substrate at T = 400 °C by changing the concentration of tungsten trioxide as [W/Mo] = 0.01, 0.05, 0.15, and, 0.2. The annealing process under sulfuration for MoS2:W thin films were studied with a sulfur concentration ratio of [S/Mo] = 2. The effect of tungsten concentration and annealing on the structural, optical absorbance, and tunning of the band gap of MoS2:W thin films was studied. The XRD results showed that the thin films before sulfuration had an orthorhombic structure and after sulfurization a hexagonal structure. Also, the crystallite size increased as considerably with increasing tungsten (W) concentration up to [W/Mo] = 0.15. The surface images of thin films by FE-SEM showed that the morphology of crystals changed after annealing and sulfuration. Also, the behavior of optical absorption coefficient (α) and extinction coefficient (k) in terms of wavelength in the UV–Vis region has been studied. The energy gap after annealing increases with increasing tungsten concentration. The optical absorption analysis showed that the direct optical gap of the thin films varies in the range ΔEg = 0.66 before annealing and in the range of ΔEg = 0.46 after annealing under sulfurization.",Optical and Quantum Electronics
Fe-doped Mo2C for boosting electrocatalytic N2 reduction,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Electrocatalytic fixation of N2 is highlighted as a carbon-free route to generate NH3, which strongly demands highly efficient and durable electrocatalysts. We explored the performance of Fe-doped-Mo2C catalysts for ammonia nitrogen reduction synthesis. We demonstrate that 5 %Fe-doped Mo2C can be an effective and durable catalyst for the electrocatalytic N2 reduction reaction (NRR). 5 %Fe-doped Mo2C achieves a remarkable NH3 yield of 36.6 μg∙h−1∙mg−1 and high faradaic efficiency of 10.3 % at 0.3 V vs RHE, far superior to Mo2C nanosheets and outperforming most reported NRR catalysts. Density functional theory (DFT) shows that 5 %Fe-doped Mo2C activates N2 molecule better than Mo2C and 11.1 %Fe-doped Mo2C, which is reflected by its lower energy barrier (0.84 eV). This research provides an attractive non-noble-metal catalyst for electrocatalytic NH3 synthesis for efficient electrocatalytic N2 fixation.",Inorganic Chemistry Communications
Influence of the target product on the electrochemical reduction of diluted CO2in a continuous flow cell,"© 2022 Elsevier Ltd.To date, research on CO2 reduction is almost exclusively performed with pure CO2 while exhaust streams often contain low concentrations of CO2. Direct usage of flue gases avoids the energy intensive CO2 capture step before utilization. This study compares the production of CO and formate on Ag and SnO2 catalysts respectively in order to find the most suitable target product for N2-diluted feed streams. Initial product selectivity screening for different CO2 feed stream compositions was performed at 100 mA/cm2. Excessive hydrogen evolution emerged below 40 % CO2 for the silver catalyst while SnO2 maintained a Faradaic efficiency to formate > 70 % even at 10 % CO2. Both catalysts were further tested at current densities up to 300 mA/cm2 and show a shift of hydrogen evolution onset to more concentrated CO2 streams. These results indicate that formate production is more interesting when utilizing N2-diluted CO2 feed streams compared to CO production.",Journal of CO2 Utilization
"Advancement in electrochemical, photocatalytic, and photoelectrochemical CO2reduction: Recent progress in the role of oxygen vacancies in catalyst design","© 2022 Wolters Kluwer Medknow Publications. All rights reserved.Due to industrialization and human activity, the level of CO2emission is increasing day by day which harshens the environment. Thus it is a very urgent need to control environmental pollution by managing the CO2level in the atmosphere. The introduction of vacancy or heteroatoms defects in the semiconductor metal oxides is one of the promising factors which improve the activity of catalysts. The defective sites revamp the donor density of metal oxides, thus providing the favorable sites involved in the catalytic reaction. Still, there is a lack of understanding mechanism of the role of oxygen vacancies in photocatalytic and electrocatalytic reactions. In this review, we have outlined the approach to control the oxygen vacancies (Vo) concentration in the metal oxides during their growth, and the mechanism of the role of Vodefect concentrations involved in the catalytic reactions. Further, we have also presented the idea of the regeneration of oxygen vacancies in the aged catalyst. Moreover, we have also highlighted the role of regeneration of oxygen vacancies involved in the regeneration of electrocatalytic activity of the metal oxides towards CO2reduction. Lastly, we have reviewed the future scope and challenges of tuning defects and their contribution to the catalytic reaction.",Journal of CO2 Utilization
"Effects of the addition of multi-walled carbon nanotubes on the microstructure and properties of Ti(C,N)-based cermets prepared by spark plasma sintering","© 2022 Elsevier Inc.To improve the toughness of Ti(C,N)-based cermets, multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) and nano-WC were added, and spark plasma sintering (SPS) technology was applied. The effects of the addition of MWCNTs on the phase composition, microstructure, and the comprehensive properties of Ti(C,N)-based cermets were investigated. The results show that the cermet (0.4 wt% MWCNTs) prepared by SPS (1350 °C, 16 min, and 35 MPa) has uniform microstructure and excellent comprehensive properties. The hardness and fracture toughness of this sample reach maximum values of HV 3050.29 and 10.90 MPa·m1/2, respectively. Compared with the sample without MWCNTs, the values are increased by 82.57% and 105.66%, respectively. A small number of carbon atoms from the MWCNTs enter the lattice of Ti (C,N) solid solution, which is conducive to improving the bonding ability and high-temperature wettability between MWCNTs and the matrix, thus enhancing the strength and toughness of the matrix materials. The addition of MWCNTs plays a bridging and toughening role at different interfaces. Moreover, the addition of nano-WC is conducive to the plastic flow and particle rearrangement of hard particles at high temperature.",Materials Characterization

Synthesis of phosphide on etched nickel foam as bifunctional electrocatalyst for urea-water electrolysis,"© 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.In this paper, firstly, nickel foam (NF) was etched in HF at different conditions. Then, Ni2P was synthesized on the etched NF (Ni2P/NF). The results indicate the concentration of HF, temperature, and etching time could affect the performance of NF, while the Ni2P synthesized on the best NF has better catalytic performance and can be used as a bifunctional catalyst for both hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and urea oxidation reaction (UOR). For the anodic UOR, it can reach 1.42 V at 100 mA·cm−2. While for the cathodic HER, the overpotential is 299 mV at 100 mA·cm−2. Thus, that nickel phosphate on etched NF has good catalytic performance and can be used as a new catalyst for the electrolytic water-urea system.",Ionics
Unraveling the formation of optimum point in NiCo-based electrocatalysts for urea oxidation reaction,"© 2022The urea oxidation reaction (UOR) has been recognized as a potential replacement for the hydrogen oxidation reaction in anion exchange membrane fuel cells, as well as the oxygen evolution reaction in water electrolyzers. For the successful application of this technology, advanced electrocatalysts for UOR must be developed to overcome the high overpotential. This can be achieved by introducing Co into Ni-based catalysts. Normally, an optimum ratio of Ni:Co would show the highest activity; however, a higher content of Co adversely affects the catalyst performance. In this study, we provide an explanation for the optimum point in NiCo-based catalysts. In addition to the positive effect of reducing the UOR onset potential, electrochemical analyses suggested that an electro-inactive species for UOR was formed by doping with Co, and this species exerted its influence more strongly as the content of Co increased. Thus, the performance was maximized at an optimum ratio of Ni:Co, at which the advantages and disadvantages of Co-doping were balanced. The results of our study indicated that Co-doping at 10 at% showed the highest UOR catalytic activity as proven by the electrochemical measurements.",Electrochimica Acta
Application of functionalized carbon nanotubes as the cathode of nonaqueous lithium‑oxygen cells,"© 2022 The AuthorsLithium‑oxygen cells have attracted the significant attention of researchers in recent years due to their extremely high energy density, comparable to the energy density of fossil fuels. However, because of the sluggish kinetics of discharge/charge reactions, the development of lithium‑oxygen technology has been largely limited. One way to tackle this problem is the development of an efficient catalyst for cathode materials that will exhibit high capacities, good rate capabilities, and sufficient stability. Due to their excellent electrochemical properties and controlled porous texture, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have been one of the candidates for this application. Many methods have been proposed to improve their catalytic activity and, as a result, enhance the performance of lithium‑oxygen cells. These include transition metal coating, precious metal decorating, or heteroatom doping. This review provides an in-depth look at CNT functionalization methods and their impact on nonaqueous lithium‑oxygen cell performance.",Solid State Ionics
"First-principles study of (Ni, Pd, Au)-embedded VS2 monolayers for adsorption of CO, H2S, NO, NO2 and SO2","© 2022 Elsevier B.V.In this paper, the sensing properties of (Ni, Pd, Au)-embedded VS2 for CO, H2S, NO, NO2 and SO2 gas molecules are investigated using first-principles. The adsorption energies, charge transfer, density of states, band structures, and work functions of five inorganic molecules on Ni-VS2 are estimated. It is clearly pointed out that these five gases are chemically adsorbed on Ni-VS2-ML. The decrease in work function indicates that Ni-VS2-ML is a candidate field effect transistor for (CO, H2S, NO, NO2 and SO2) detection. The properties of the (CO, H2S, NO, NO2 and SO2)/Ni-VS2-ML systems are also investigated under biaxial strain. The results show that applying biaxial strain is an effective strategy to tune the sensing performance of (CO, H2S, NO, NO2 and SO2)/Ni-VS2-ML.",FlatChem
Ammonia as hydrogen carrier: Advances in ammonia decomposition catalysts for promising hydrogen production,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdOn-site ammonia decomposition has been considered as a potential candidate to alleviate the challenges of hydrogen storage and transportation by utilizing NH3 (with a high hydrogen content of 17.6 wt%) as hydrogen carrier, along with the flourish of renewable energy. Although the decomposition of NH3 into H2 is thermodynamically favorable at above 400 °C, the reaction kinetics remains sluggish due to the high activation energy for N–H bond cleavage and N2 desorption. This motivates the design and construction of functional catalysts with high-efficiency and low-cost. To date, a variety of metal-based catalysts have been investigated for NH3 decomposition, among which Ru often shows the highest activity due to its optimal metal–nitrogen binding energy. Efforts are being devoted to the further improvement of catalytic performance through tuning the morphology, electronic structure, defect/doping and metal–support interaction. Meanwhile, advanced techniques are employed to disclose the structure–performance relationship of catalyst. Herein, this review identifies the fundamental principles of catalytic NH3 decomposition, addresses the advances on current catalyst design, summarizes the strategies to enhancing efficiency, and provides recommendations for further material design. A comprehensive consideration of recent development of noble metal and transition metal catalysts are provided, as well as the promoters and supports. Moreover, the advantage of using bimetallic materials, which offers a synergy to modulate the electronic structure and improve the intrinsic activity, is emphasized. This review may serve as an informative work to inspire the future development of ammonia decomposition catalyst for practical application.",Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews
N-doped macroporous carbon loading Mo2C as cathode electrocatalyst of hybrid neutral-alkaline microbial electrolysis cells for H2 generation,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdMicrobial electrolysis cells (MECs) show promise in energy-effective hydrogen (H2) production by harvesting electric energy from wastewater, while the implementation of such a desirable technique faces challenges of expensive cathodic catalysts and unfavorable neutral electrolyte for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). This work presents a simple and cost-effective pyrolysis route to fabricate hybrid electrocatalysts of Mo2C loaded nitrogen-doped porous carbon (Mo2C/NC). The Mo2C/NC-800 catalyst delivers impressively high activity and durability in pH-varied electrolyte from alkali, neutral and acid, particularly in alkali condition (e.g. 1.0 M KOH) where the overpotential@10 mA cm−2 is only 138 mV which is comparable to the commercial Pt/C catalysts. A hybrid neutral-alkaline MEC is therefore developed that uses Mo2C/NC as the cathode catalyst for H2 production. The system requires an applied voltage of 1.0 V to achieve current density of ∼20.0 A m−2 at H2 generation rate of 170.5 L m−2 d−1. This MEC performance is considerably higher than that of the traditional symmetric neutral counterpart that requires an applied voltage of 1.0 V to achieve current density of ∼18.0 A m−2 at H2 generation rate of 159.4 L m−2 d−1 indicating promising potential of Mo2C/NC electrocatalyst to be applied in MEC device for H2 generation.",Electrochimica Acta
"Hydrothermal construction of flower-like CuS microsphere electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reactions in alkaline fresh water, alkaline seawater, and seawater","© 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.Green hydrogen energy production from electrocatalysts produced via low-temperature hydrothermal method with easy preparation and cost effectiveness has attracted attention as an alternative to high-temperature nitration, phosphide, and sulfonation processes. Hence, in this work with consideration of previous works, we have prepared low temperatures (60°C-80°C) surfactant assisted copper sulfide (CuS) spherical flower-like microsphere morphologies with the help of the hydrothermal technique. The product exhibited a single CuS covellite phase at 60°C, whereas the increase in hydrate phase was also observed along with the CuS phase at 70°C and 80°C. SEM and TEM analyses revealed that increase in the size of flower-like microsphere morphology with the covellite phase was observed with an increase in reaction temperatures. The vibrational mode at 616 and 472 cm−1 confirmed the formation of CuS in FTIR and Raman spectra respectively. The CuS catalyst obtained at 80°C achieved low 176, 199, and 458 mV overpotentials to get 10 mA/cm2 in 1 M KOH of distilled water, 1 M KOH of seawater, and natural seawater compared to other CuS catalysts on account of the higher surface area of 16.19 m2/g. The CuS catalyst prepared at 80°C showed low charge transfer resistance (Rct) at catalyst/seawater interface compared to other catalysts with the retention of 74.1% in natural seawater after 10 h stability examination. Structural and compositional studies of the CuS catalyst prepared at 80°C after 10 h stability examination confirmed white Mg(OH)2 and Ca(OH)2 precipitate formation on CuS surface.",International Journal of Energy Research
BIAN-based durable polymer metal complex as a cathode material for Li–O2 battery applications,"© 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to The Society of Polymer Science, Japan.Among several strategies employed to reduce overpotential and achieve reliable reversibility with Li–O2 batteries, the use of atomically dispersed bifunctional carbon catalysts is very attractive. However, most of the methods used to prepare these bifunctional oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts require high temperatures and exhibit low yields, and it is therefore difficult to predetermine the active sites qualitatively and quantitatively. Here, we propose the use of atomically dispersed metal centers coordinated to diimine moieties of conjugated polymers as bifunctional catalysts without further modification (pyrolysis or composite formation) for Li–O2 battery applications. Poly(bisiminoacenaphthenequinone) (BIAN) iron complex (BP-Fe) catalysts showed high OER activities, which enabled 100% coulombic efficiency for 160 galvanostatic charge discharge cycles with a capacity limit of 500 mAh/g at a current density of 250 mA/g. The overpotential corresponding to charging was as low as ~1.0 V and exhibited almost no change in discharge overpotential across 160 cycles. Additionally, it showed a commendable rate capability with only a 170 mV increase in charge overpotential when the charge‒discharge rate was increased from 100 to 500 mA/g.",Polymer Journal
"Ab initio calculation of the adsorption of As, Cd, Cr, and Hg heavy metal atoms onto the illite(001) surface: Implications for soil pollution and reclamation","© 2022 Elsevier LtdElucidating the mechanisms of heavy metal (HM) adsorption on clay minerals is key to solving HM pollution in soil. In this study, the adsorption of four HM atoms (As, Cd, Cr, and Hg) on the illite(001) surface was investigated using density functional theory calculations. Different adsorption configurations were investigated and the electronic properties (i.e., adsorption energy (Ead) and electron transfer) were analyzed. The Ead values of the four HM atoms on the illite(001) surface were found to be As > Cr > Cd > Hg. The Ead values for the most stable adsorption configurations of As, Cr, Cd, and Hg were −1.8554, −0.7982, −0.3358, and −0.2678 eV, respectively. The As atoms show effective chemisorption at all six adsorption sites, while Cd, Cr, and Hg atoms mainly exhibited physisorption. The hollow and top (O) sites were more favorable than the top (K) sites for the adsorption of HM atoms. The Gibbs free energy results show that the illite(001) surface was energetically favorable for the adsorption of As and Cr atoms under the influence of 298 K and 1 atm. After adsorption, there was a redistribution of positions and reconfiguration of the chemical bonding of the surface atoms, with a non-negligible influence around the upper surface atoms. Bader charge analysis shows electrons were transferred from the surface to the HM atoms, and a strong correlation between the valence electron variations and the adsorption energy was observed. HM atoms had a high electronic state overlap with the surface O atoms near the Fermi energy level, indicating that the surface O atoms, though not the topmost atoms around the surface, significantly influence HM adsorption. The above results show illite(001) preferentially adsorbed As among all four investigated HM atoms, indicating that soils containing a high proportion of illite might be more prone to As pollution.",Environmental Pollution
Graphene-based lithium-ion battery anode materials manufactured by mechanochemical ball milling process: A review and perspective,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdGraphene-based anodes have been broadly used in energy storage devices, in which introducing heteroatom to graphene can endow the pristine graphene with improved optical, physicochemical, structural, and electromagnetic properties, and integrating active anodes with graphene can compensate for the weakness of pristine materials and tailor the overall electrochemical performance. Remarkably, ball milling has been considered as a powerful mixing and exfoliation method for dealing with graphene materials in a high-efficient and large-scale way. By applying the ball milling technology, graphene doping and graphene compositing can be easily realized in a cost-effective and scalable manner. In this review, the current progress in doped graphene such as fluorine, chlorine, bromine, iodine, nitrogen, and sulfur-doped graphene manufactured by ball milling are introduced and discussed in depth. Then, graphene-based composite anodes, such as graphene/silicon, graphene/silicon oxide, graphene/tin, graphene/silicon oxide, graphene/germanium, and graphene/iron oxide et al., are demonstrated by revealing their mechanisms for performance improvements. Finally, we present some challenges and potential directions of graphene-based anodes in the conclusion and outlook part. It is predicted that the mechanochemical ball milling technique will enormously facilitate the exploitation of advanced heteroatom-doped graphene and graphene composite anode materials in lithium-ion batteries.",Composites Part B: Engineering

Suppression of extra carriers for enhanced intrinsic piezoelectric properties of ultrathin MoS2 through various metal dopants,"© 2022We study the piezoelectric behavior of metal-doped monolayer MoS2. Its three-dimensional charge density, work function (WF), and piezoresponse with various metal dopants are theoretically predicted based on density functional theory, and the real-time piezoelectric power of these samples is experimentally verified. Selected p-type metal dopants (Au, Ag, Pd, Pt, and Al) increase the WF of monolayer MoS2, affecting electron emission from the MoS2 surface. The reason is that p-type metal dopants suppress excess electrons and prevent screening effects. A nanogenerator constructed from Au-doped monolayer MoS2 has been used to explore the possibility of a practical device.",Composites Part B: Engineering
Improving the catalytic activity of Pt-Rh/C towards ethanol oxidation through the addition of Pb,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdThis paper describes the effect of composition on the catalytic activity of carbon-supported Pt-Pb, Pt-Rh, and Pt-Rh-Pb catalysts towards ethanol oxidation in acid media. The catalysts were synthesised by a polyol reduction method and characterised using several experimental techniques, including X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray absorption near edge structure, and X-ray energy dispersive spectroscopy. The catalytic activity towards ethanol oxidation was evaluated by cyclic voltammetry, chronoamperometry, and in situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) experiments. XRD data indicate the presence of Pb in both alloyed and oxide forms. TEM images reveal nanoparticles well-dispersed on the carbon support, with spherical shapes and particle sizes around 2.0–6.5 nm. The Pt3RhPb/C catalyst showed the highest catalytic activity for ethanol oxidation, reaching current densities 6.0 times higher than the commercial Pt/C catalyst. The trimetallic catalyst showed the highest CO2 and acetic acid formation, explaining the higher current densities presented during cyclic voltammetry and chronoamperometry. Additionally, since the oxidation appears to follow a non-selective path, the role of Pb in the trimetallic catalyst is not related to driving the reaction towards the production of CO2. The improvement in catalytic activity occurred due to the synergy between the metals.",Electrochimica Acta
Prediction of the catalytic site of single-atom Ni catalyst using the hydrogen evolution reaction as a model platform,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdNiNC catalysts, in which Ni ions are atomically dispersed by ligation with nitrogen functionalities on a carbon support, have received considerable attention owing to their promising activity in the electrochemical reduction of CO2 to CO. However, a poor catalytic activity has been theoretically predicted for the conventional metalloporphyrin-like catalytic moieties, symmetric Ni-N4. This has led to extensive debate regarding the nature of the actual catalytic site. In this study, we prepare five MeNC catalysts (Me = Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, or Ni) with predominant Me-N4 moieties and measure their hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activities. A linear correlation is identified between the HER activity and the theoretically predicted hydrogen binding energy (HBE) of all the symmetric Me-N4 models, except for Ni-N4. Thus, various coordination structures are further considered as catalytic Ni sites. Based on the combination of experimental and theoretical approaches, we conclude that coordinately unsaturated Ni sites can be present, which are responsible for the considerable electrocatalytic activity of the NiNC.",Electrochimica Acta
Electrochemical reduction of CO2 on Cu doped titanium nanotubes—An insight on ethylene selectivity,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdElectrochemical reduction of CO2 is performed on Cu electrodeposited Ti nanotubes (Cu/TiNT). TiNT is prepared by anodization method followed by electrodeposition of Cu and the CO2 reduction achieved is compared with that of bare electrodes. The comparison between Cu/TiNT and TiNT is done based on the characterization techniques of Scanning Electron Microscopy, X-ray Diffraction, Transmission Electron Microscopy, X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy and UV-Diffuse Reflectance Spectroscopy. Electrochemical reduction of CO2 is carried out in an H-type cell with 0.5 M KCl electrolyte, and ethylene, methane, formic acid, CO, hydrogen along with methanol and ethanol are observed as trace products. Among the electrodes studied, maximum Faradaic efficiency (55%) is observed for Cu/TiNT compared to TiNT and bare electrodes. To understand the mechanism of CO2 reduction which produces ethylene on the surface, calculations of first principles are carried out for the Ti nanotubes with Cu deposition on the surface and the binding configurations of various intermediates are studied. The result of first principle calculation shows that the ethylene formation on the Cu deposited surface is favorable than the methane which is in line with the experimental observation.",Electrochimica Acta
Ionic liquid-based (nano)catalysts for hydrogen generation and storage,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.The growing worldwide energy requirements, the reduction of fossil fuels and the corresponding environmental problems are encouraging researchers to study different types of pure and sustainable energy generation, storage, and usage technologies. Efficient hydrogen (H2) generation would offer the possibility of harvesting renewable energy in the form of clean fuels for many applications. To achieve this objective, H2 generation through hydrolysis of hydrides, electrochemical, and photocatalytic H2 evolution methods are the most effective, affordable, and clean techniques. On the other hand, recent claims of the high efficiency of ionic liquid-based (nano)catalysts (ILBCs) have inspired significant research regarding the application of these compounds in the production of high purity H2 through cost-effective and straightforward processes. Herein, we review electrocatalytic and photocatalytic H2 evolution reaction methods, H2 generation from hydrolysis of hydrides, and the performance of ILBCs in each of these methods. We believe that the contents of this review raise the interest of chemists working on catalysis and inspire more efforts in studying ILBCs.",Journal of Molecular Liquids
Phosphorus and nitrogen codoped entangled carbon nanotubes forming spongy materials: Synthesis and characterization,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Carbon sponges are of great interest of the scientific community given their potential in advanced applications such as water cleaning, catalysis, energy storage, and mechanical reinforcement. These carbon nanomaterials improve their attributes for unexpected properties and applications by doping with foreign atoms. Nitrogen‑phosphorus-codoped and functionalized carbon nanotube sponges (NP-CNTSs) were synthesized, using the aerosol-assisted chemical vapor deposition (AACVD) method. We used acetonitrile and triphenylphosphine (TPP) as nitrogen and phosphorus precursors. According to our results, the NP-CNTSs were formed by entangled multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) of diameters ranging between 60 and 300 nm with Fe2P and Fe3C nanoparticles in the walls and inside the carbon nanotube sponges (CNTSs) respectively. The Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) characterization revealed the vibrational modes of aromatic and aliphatic C[sbnd]H, P[dbnd]O, P[sbnd]H, and O[dbnd]C[sbnd]N bonds. The NP-CNTSs undergo a quasi-reversible hydroquinone/quinone redox process as revealed by cyclic voltammetry studies. They also efficiently retain organic solvents, absorbing up to 40 times their weight for dichlorobenzene. The XPS and Raman characterizations show the presence of pyridinic nitrogen, which might be responsible for the formation of cavities in the wall of the CNTSs and the entanglement of carbon nanotubes, which promotes the growth of the NP-CNTSs. To study the role of nitrogen and phosphorus in the electronic properties of carbon materials, we carried out calculations proposed in the density functional theory (DFT) for phosphorus‑nitrogen codoping bilayer graphene and carbon nanotube junctions containing pentagonal, hexagonal, and heptagonal carbon rings.",Diamond and Related Materials
High-performance microfluidic electrochemical reactor for efficient hydrogen evolution,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdHydrogen production from water electrolysis provides an effective bridge between the existing energy system and the layout of green renewable energy. Electrochemical hydrogen gas evolution on the electrode surface will occupy the limited active sites thus significantly increasing the reaction overpotential. It is crucial to study and optimize the bubble behavior on the electrode surface to improve reaction efficiency and lower the energy loss. Herein, a microfluidic electrochemical reactor (MER) has been constructed to optimize the surface gas-liquid two-phase flow behavior during the gas evolution process. The obtained results demonstrate the feasibility of microfluidic design in manipulating the bubble behavior at the electrode interface accompanied with the self-generated gas-liquid two-phase flow, which can directly reduce the overpotentials by facilitating the mass transfer and refreshing catalytic active sites. Compared with conventional H-cell, state-of-the-art efficient and stable performance of hydrogen evolution has been achieved, where the increase in current density was more than 5 times.

Ion doping synergistic with vacancy engineering improves the electrochemical intrinsic performance in the OER process and has enhanced electron transfer ability and electrochemical specific surface area, thus exhibiting high electrocatalytic OER performance, small Tafel slopes, ultralow overpotential of 294 mV at 100 mA cm−2 and 276 mV at 50 mA cm−2 and robust operating durability. Combined with DFT calculations, the role of Ce ions in the NiFe bimetallic sulfide system was revealed. This work not only provides a strategy for designing ion doping to enhance vacancy concentration but also constructs an efficient and stable oxygen evolution electrocatalyst system, which provides an alternative path for designing efficient electric and photocatalysts.",Electrochimica Acta
A2BC-type meso-imidazolylporphyrins – New class of prospective polyfunctional molecules,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdA convenient synthetic strategy for the efficient preparation of new functionalized low-symmetry A2BC-type porphyrins bearing meso-areneimidazolyl fragment is developed. The reactivity of the key precursors, namely 5-bromo-15-imidazolylporphyrins, in C–C-coupling reactions was evaluated providing access to target functional derivatives. Two types of electron-withdrawing groups, namely cyano- and phenylcarboxy-ones, were introduced to the meso-position, opposite to the heterocyclic substituent. It allowed preparation of prospective push-pull derivatives along with the introduction of latent anchoring groups to the macrocycle. The peculiarities of the mutual intramolecular dynamic processes in the prepared compounds were revealed and investigated by means of variable-temperature NMR. DFT calculations of the structure, molecular orbitals and rotation activation barriers were performed, that revealed the conformational dependence of the orbitals localization. Altogether the obtained results form the basis for the rational design of highly unsymmetrical and polarized porphyrin derivatives with tunable properties.",Dyes and Pigments
PBA functionalized single-atom Fe for efficient therapy of multidrug-resistant bacterial infections,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.The abuse of antibiotics has led to the emergence of multidrug-resistant bacterial strains worldwide, which greatly threatens human health. In the present work, we developed single-atom catalysts (SACs) with atomically dispersed Fe as catalytic sites (Fe-SACs) to combat multidrug-resistant bacteria by elevating cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS). Our intensive studies confirmed that Fe-SACs were successfully prepared and exhibited excellent catalase (CAT)-, oxidase (OXD)-, and peroxidase (POD)-like activities. To enhance water dispersibility, biosafety and the interactions between the nanodrugs and gram-positive bacteria, phenylboronic acid group-functionalized carboxylated chitosan (CCS-PBA) was coated on the surface of Fe-SACs to yield Fe-SACs@CCS-PBA for in vitro and in vivo studies. The synergistic catalytic activity and photothermal activity of Fe-SACs@CCS-PBA effectively overcame multidrug-resistant bacterial strains (MRSA) in vitro and significantly accelerated wound healing in vivo, suggesting the great potential of SACs to overcome infectious disease caused by multidrug-resistant bacteria.",Colloids and Surfaces B: Biointerfaces

Sustainable aqueous metal-air batteries: An insight into electrolyte system,"© 2022To meet the growing demand for sustainable and endurable energy sources, various novel energy conversion and storage systems have emerged and been developed rapidly over the last decades. Aqueous metal-air batteries have aroused much interest owing to their superior energy density, exceptional reliability, and environmental benignity. Nevertheless, the practical discharge performance of aqueous metal-air batteries is far below that desired. In comparison to the electrode materials design with much effort, relatively minor attention has been paid to the development of electrolyte systems, which undoubtedly is crucial for battery properties. In order to stimulate and promote the development of electrolyte systems for high-performance aqueous metal-air batteries, in-depth insight into the working mechanism of aqueous metal-air batteries and recent advances on electrolytes development are presented in this work.

Porous aerogel with aligned hierarchical channels based on chitosan and halloysite for efficient solar steam generation,"© 2022Solar steam generation (SSG) with efficient interface-evaporation manner has recently emerged as one of the promising approaches to produce fresh water. In this work, halloysite-based SSG (H1) with aligned channels was prepared from halloysite (Hal) and chitosan (CS) by directional freezing and simple carbonization. Then modified the sides and lower surface of H1 to obtain oleophobic generator H2. The as-prepared H1 possess high light absorption (Ca.97.4), excellent thermal insulation (0.086 W m−1 K−1 in dry state), and abundant porosity (75.6%). Furthermore, the halloysite based evaporator H1 with unique aligned channels can ensure timely water transportation. As a result, leading to a high evaporation rate of 1.58 kg m−2 h−1 with an excellent photothermal conversion efficiency of 95.5% under 1 kW m−2 illumination. In addition, the hydrogel-based evaporation H1 also exhibits superior salt-resistant performance for solar desalination in high concentration brine, and the purified water from artificial seawater can achieve the WHO's standard for ion concentration of drinking water. Moreover, after modification the oleophobic H2 exhibit an excellent evaporation performance in oily water, and can reach to a high conversion efficiency of 86.0%.

Rationally designed negative electrode for selective CO2-to-CO conversion in protonic ceramic electrochemical cells,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdProtonic ceramic electrochemical cells (PCECs) are solid-state electrochemical devices that employ proton-conducting oxides as electrolytes, which offer a promising approach for electrification of chemical manufacturing, including CO2 reduction to produce value-added chemicals (e.g., CO). The primary advantage of PCECs is their intermediate operating temperatures (300–600 °C), which thermodynamically and kinetically favor the CO2 reduction chemistry at the negative electrode. However, the conventional negative electrodes of PCECs, such as BaZr0.8−xCexY0.2O3-δ-Ni or BaZr0.8−xCexY0.1Yb0.1O3-δ-Ni, cannot reduce CO2 to either CH4 or CO with a selectivity of >99 %, leading to the production of a CO and CH4 mixture. Herein, an oxide-supported in-situ exsolved Ni-Fe alloyed nanoparticle electrocatalyst, Sr2Fe1.4Mo0.5O6-δ-Ni0.175 (SFM-Ni0.175), is first employed as the negative electrode of PCECs. The PCECs equipped with this new negative electrode selectively favor the CO2-to-CO conversion. A selectivity of ~100 % toward CO has been demonstrated over a wide range of operating temperatures (400–600 °C) and applied potentials/current densities. The negative electrode demonstrated in this work fully suppresses the CH4 production. In situ diffuse reflectance infrared spectroscopy (DRIFTS) was performed to probe the CO2 reduction mechanisms over both SFM-Ni0.175 and the traditional negative electrode (BCZYYb7111 +Ni), which indicates SFM-Ni0.175 inhibits the formation of formate species, leading to selective production of CO. This work validates that PCECs equipped with the rationally designed negative electrode can selectively manufacture chemicals.",Nano Energy
"Self-supported Co, P-codoped MnCO3 pyramid as an efficient Electrocatalyst for hydrogen evolution reaction","© 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.Polyhydride electrocatalysts integrated directly into metal substrates have attracted attention because they can provide high electrochemical specific surface area and excellent mechanical properties. In this work, through the classical hydrothermal method and subsequent phosphating procedure, we synthesized for the first time an electrocatalyst with a pyramid-shaped MnCO3 as the main structure, P and Co as co-doping elements, named Co, P-MnCO3, and used it as hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The experimental results show that the excellent catalytic activity in alkaline media, with current densities of 10 and 200 mA∙cm−2 at 61 mV and 158 mV and low overpotentials, which are better than P-Co (108/234 mV) and P-MnCO3 (175 mV/340 mV), etc. it has more electrochemically active sites, faster charge transfer rate and lower resistance. The excellent electrochemical properties benefit from the unique highly active binary Co, P-MnCO3 pyramid brick sites shortened the ion transfer distance and optimized synergistic effect between the doped metal elements (Co,P between MnCO3), the porous connection between Co, P-MnCO3 and the high conductivity substrate, increased the electron-transfer efficiency between the substrate and material, accelerating the conversion of H+ to H2; facilitated the release of bubbles and provided excellent mechanical properties for improved catalyst stability. This work provides a new idea for the synthesis of multi-element electrocatalysts.",International Journal of Energy Research
Porphyrin- and phthalocyanine-based systems for rechargeable batteries,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Porphyrin and phthalocyanine, typically planar aromatic macrocyclic molecules, have attracted considerable attention for application in rechargeable batteries due to their highly conjugated π-electron system, highly stable C[sbnd]N bonds and bipolar features. In particular, the structure diversity from the central metal and the peripheral substitution groups not only endows them multiple functions in various rechargeable batteries, but also makes them as structural units to construct various framework structures. Herein, a timely and systematic review about porphyrin- and phthalocyanine-based systems for rechargeable batteries is thoroughly summarized for the first time. Especially, their multiple functions and reaction mechanisms as redox active sites, redox mediators, O2/CO2 shuttles or electrocatalysts for metal ion batteries, dual-ion batteries, Li-S batteries, Li-O2 batteries or Li-CO2 batteries are also summarized and discussed. In addition, the merging porphyrin- and phthalocyanine-based frameworks are timely highlighted. Finally, current challenges and future perspectives are proposed.

Efficient peroxymonosulfate activation of immobilized Fe–N–C catalyst on ceramsite for the continuous flow removal of phenol,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdNowadays, developing environmentally friendly catalysts with both low cost and high efficiency was still a challenge in actual organic wastewater purification. Herein, the Fe–N–C catalyst was successfully immobilized on solid waste derived ceramsite for efficient degradation of phenol under continuous flow conditions by activating peroxymonosulfate (PMS). After the introduction of ceramsite, the microstructure of Fe–N–C catalyst was changed from granular structure to worm-like structure, promoting the dispersion of the nanoscale catalyst and providing more reactive sites. Therefore, the phenol removal rate and mineralization rate of the obtained 0.5FNNC within 30 min were up to 96.79% and 71.79%, respectively. In addition, the degradation rate of the optimal composite (0.5FNNC)/PMS system was about 4.06 times higher than that of bare Fe–N–C/PMS system. Intriguingly, the Fe ion leaching from 0.5FNNC during the degradation reaction was significantly lower than bare Fe–N–C owing to the strong catalyst-support chemical bonding. Based on electron paramagnetic resonance, quenching experiments, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis and electrochemical analysis, it was indicated that the non-radical processes (1O2 and high valent iron-oxo species) should be responsible for the phenol degradation. Meanwhile, the possible phenol degradation pathways were proposed, and the intermediates were evaluated for ecotoxicity by ECOSAR. Finally, a preliminary economic analysis of this process was carried out. Overall, this work would provide a new strategy for the construction of ceramsite based multi-pore composite catalysts and the large-scale application of persulfate oxidation technology in organic wastewater treatment.",Chemosphere
Identifying single-atom catalysts for boosted Al–S conversion reactions,"© 2022Aluminum–sulfur (Al–S) battery is a promising energy storage system owing to its safety, crustal abundance and high theoretical energy density. However, its development is hindered by the sluggish reaction kinetics and poor reversibility. Herein, a series of porous carbon supported atomic transition metal catalysts (SATM@NC) were considered to evaluate the catalytic activities in Al–S applications. Both theoretical and experimental results indicated that stable SATM@NC all promote the Al–S conversion reactions. Batteries assembled with SACo@NC/S demonstrated a high specific capacity of 509.4 mA h g − 1 at 1 A g − 1 after 200 cycles. In mechanism, atomic metal species weakened Al-S bonds of AlPSs and increased their reactivity. Particularly, distinctive Al-binding interaction between AlPSs and SACo@NC was critical for its superior catalytic activity. This work gives a systematically understanding of single-atom catalyst for Al–S chemistry, and provides enlightenment for high performance Al–S batteries.",Energy Storage Materials
Catalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction in alkaline medium: Configuring a cooperative mechanism at the Ag-Ag2S-MoS2 interface,"© 2022 Science Press and Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of SciencesDesigning electrocatalysts for HER in alkaline conditions to overcome the sluggish kinetics associated with the additional water dissociation step is a recognized challenge in promoting the hydrogen economy. To this end, delicately tuning the atomic-scale structure and surface composition of nanoparticles is a common strategy and, specifically, making use of hybrid structures, can produce synergistic effects that lead to highly active catalysts. Here, we present a core-shell catalyst of Ag@MoS2 that shows promising results towards the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in both 0.5 M H2SO4 and 0.5 M KOH. In this hybrid structure, the MoS2 shell is strained and defective, and charge transfer occurs between the conductive core and the shell, contributing to the electrocatalytic activity. The shelling process results in a large fraction of Ag2S in the cores, and adjusting the relative fractions of Ag, Ag2S, and MoS2 leads to improved catalytic activity and fast charge-transfer kinetics. We suggest that the enhancement of alkaline HER is associated with a cooperative effect of the interfaces, where the Ag(I) sites in Ag2S drive the water dissociation step, and the formed hydrogen subsequently recombines on the defective MoS2 shell. This study demonstrates the benefits of hybrid structures as functional nanomaterials and provides a scheme to activate MoS2 for HER in alkaline conditions.",Journal of Energy Chemistry
"Interface modulation induced by the 1T Co-WS2 shell nanosheet layer at the metallic NiTe2/Ni core–nanoskeleton: Glib electrode-kinetics for HER, OER, and ORR","© 2022 Elsevier LtdThe metallic (1T) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) are known for their superior electrocatalytic performance, due to their high conductivity, active basal-planes, and exposed edges. Our novel approach of coupling a metallic-NiTe2/Ni nano-skeleton with 1T-Co-WS2 nanosheet in a core–shell arrangement to develop a hybrid heterostructure (1T Co-WS2/NiTe2/Ni) has helped to outperform the trifunctional-electrocatalytic activity (HER, OER, and ORR). 1T-Co-WS2/NiTe2/Ni only requires ultralow overpotential (ηHER = 88 mV@10, ηOER = 290 mV@30), higher half-wave potential for ORR (E1/2 = 0.781 V vs RHE), small Tafel slopes (HER = 68 mV dec-1, OER = 98 mV dec-1, and ORR = 63 mV dec-1) with high electrocatalytic surface area and robust stability in corresponding half-cell reactions. The designed heterostructured electrocatalyst (1T Co-WS2/NiTe2/Ni) presented exceptional total water-splitting performance, requiring a low voltage of 1.521 V to yield 10 mA cm−2 current with extensive structural and electrochemical durability. Such performance could be attributed towards improved nanochannel morphology with exposed active edge, fluent electrode-kinetics, facile adsorption–desorption of reaction intermediates owing to the intrinsically tuned 1T-WS2 by cobalt-doping, and hybridized NiTe2/Ni nano-skeleton. The DFT study confirmed that the incorporation of Co atoms in basal plane and the edge sites of WS2 lattice induces the redistribution and modulation of electronic structure for fast electron/charge transfer and the synergistic coupling of 1T NiTe2 heterostructures bolstered the electrocatalytic activity of the as-prepared catalysts. These outcomes provide a prospect towards the design and application of efficient 2D/2D heterostructured electrocatalyst for zero emission energy goal.",Nano Energy
Single-phase bimetal sulfide or metal sulfide heterojunction: Which one is better for reversible oxygen electrocatalyst?,"© 2022 Science Press and Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of SciencesBimetallic sulfides, integrating the merits of individual components, are ideal structures for efficient electrocatalysis. However, for bimetallic sulfides including metal sulfide heterojunctions (MSH) and single-phase bimetallic sulfides (SBS), it is still unclear about which one has better catalytic activity toward reversible oxygen catalysis and its difference on catalytic mechanism. In this work, we demonstrate a bimetallic sulfide electrocatalyst that could transform from metal sulfide heterojunction (CoS/FeS) to single-phase bimetallic sulfide (CoFeS2) through a facile temperature control strategy. The single-phase bimetallic sulfide (CoFeS2) affords high intrinsic activity, fast reaction kinetics and superior durability toward oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Density functional theory (DFT) simulations reveal that the (CoFeS2) has homogeneous electron distribution of the CoFeS2 structure, improves the central energy level of d band, and optimizes the O* and OOH* intermediate and efficiently reduces the energy barrier of the reaction rate-determining step (RDS). The assembled rechargeable zinc-air battery is more stable than the Pt/C and IrO2 assemblies due to the excellent electrocatalytic activity and stability of CoFeS2/NC, suggesting that it has potential for use in practical applications.",Journal of Energy Chemistry

Highly efficient and stable catalysts-covalent organic framework-supported palladium particles for 4-nitrophenol catalytic hydrogenation,"© 2022A covalent organic framework (COF) was used as the support of the catalyst in this work in order to obtain an environmentally friendly catalyst with high catalytic performance, selectivity and stability for 4-nitrophenol hydrogenation. Pd tiny particles are fixed in the cavity of COF to obtain Pd/COF catalysts, which has a quite narrow particle size distribution (5.09 ± 1.30 nm). As-prepared Pd/COF catalysts (Pd loading-2.11 wt%) shows excellent catalytic performance (conversion - 99.3%, selectivity >99.0% and turnover frequency (TOF)-989.4 h−1) for 4-nitrophenol hydrogenation under relatively mild reaction conditions of reaction temperature-40 °C and reaction pressure-3.0 MPa H2, and Pd/COF catalysts have high stability.

Atomic-scale insights into the role of non-covalent interactions in electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdUnderstanding the non-covalent interactions occurring at electrocatalytic interfaces is important to promote the development of advanced hydrogen evolution systems. However, the exact role of non-covalent interaction in the electrode–electrolyte interface on the HER kinetics remains obscure at the molecular level, especially for non-platinum-based electrodes. This is due to the lack of an effective strategy to decouple the effect of each interaction (ΔGH, noncovalent interactions) on the HER kinetics. Accordingly, herein, we constructed a model catalyst surface (Pd,RuSOy) to decouple the influence of ΔGH and double-layer structure optimization on HER kinetics, thus exploring the role of this non-covalent interactions on the HER at the molecular level. We found that hydrated cations located in the outer Helmholtz plane (OHP) also interact directly with electrode materials and the strength of these interactions would also affect the HER activity. Consequently, Pd,RuS2−xOy exhibited remarkable electrocatalytic activity toward HER, which delivered low overpotentials of 38 and 82 mV at 10 and 100 mA cm−2, respectively. This study not only illustrates the roles of interfacial interactions, but also provides a new way for the rational design of advanced electrocatalysts.",Nano Energy
Electronic structure modulation of multi-walled carbon nanotubes using azo dye for inducing non-radical reaction: Effect of graphitic nitrogen and structural defect,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdMultiwalled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) have a great potential for advanced oxidation process as a metal free catalyst. However, there catalytic activity is very low and needs to be appropriately tuned. Herein, we demonstrate a novel synthesis method for tuning the defect and surface functionality of MWCNT using azo dyes and the catalytic performance was tested for the degradation of different organic contaminates using PMS as an oxidant. The content, type of heteroatom functional groups, and the defect parameters were optimized by varying the pH and concentration of the organic dye. The quenching effect showed that singlet oxygen (1O2) is the primary reactive species generated by graphitic nitrogen, which can be boosted by the degree of graphitic structure disruption in MWCNT. The Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) also confirmed that extrinsic doping enhanced the non-radical degradation by increasing the direct charge transfer rate from MB to PMS. Moreover, the designed catalyst showed a fast degradation performance with 35.1 kJ/mol activation energy and achieved the highest dye degradation rate and even surpassed some state-of-the-art metal-based and metal-free catalysts. The effect of inorganic anions study has also confirmed its industrial applicability.",Chemosphere
Bifunctional oxygen electrode cobalt–nickel sulfides catalysts originated from intercalated LDH precursors,"© 2022 Science Press and Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of SciencesBimetallic cobalt–nickel sulfide nanoparticles anchored on S-, N-codoped holey carbon nanosheets (CoNi-S-T@NCFs) with a hydrangea-like morphology, were synthesized via a confinement synthesis route, in which an intercalated LDH precursor was subjected to the interlayer-confined carbonization and host-layer sulfurization. The phase transformation and structure evolution (e.g., atom site occupancy, crystallite size, and cell volume) of the CoNi-S-T@NCFs electrocatalysts, as a function of sulfurization temperatures, were confirmed by X-ray diffraction and Rietveld analyses. The sulfur vacancies effectively enhance the electrocatalytic activity, while the synergistic effect of (Co,Ni)7S8 alloy and S, N-codoped carbon matrix facilitates the electron transfer and accelerates reaction kinetics, making CoNi-S-900@NCFs an efficient and stable bifunctional electrocatalyst for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The rich high-valence Co (III) and Ni (III) of CoNi-S-900@NCFs facilitates the in-situ transformation of the metal (oxy)hydroxides intermediates with high catalytic activity for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Thus, with a bifunctional parameter, ΔE, of 0.75 V (Ej=10, OER - E1/2, ORR), this electrocatalyst slightly outperforms the state-of-the-art commercial Pt/C + RuO2/C catalyst (ΔE = 0.76 V) in alkaline medium. This work demonstrates the influence that the sulfurization temperature has on the relationship between the structure and electrocatalytic performance of bimetallic sulfides prepared by the synthesis strategy using the intercalated LDH precursor. This strategy can be extended to prepare other chalcogenides with binary or ternary transition metals.",Journal of Energy Chemistry
A newly-designed free-standing NiCo2O4 nanosheet array as effective mediator to activate peroxymonosulfate for rapid degradation of emerging organic pollutant with high concentration,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdNowadays effective treatment of high concentration organic wastewater is still a formidable task facing human beings. Herein, for the first time, a well-defined ZIF-67-derived NiCo2O4 nanosheet array was successfully prepared by a feasible method. In comparison with ordinary NiCo2O4 nanosphere, the formation of nanosheet structure could offer more opportunities to exposure internal active sites of NiCo2O4, thereby resulting in smaller interface resistance and higher charge transfer efficiency. As expected, ZIF-67-derived NiCo2O4 nanosheet array displayed great performance in peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation. More importantly, recyclable redox couples of Co3+/Co2+ and Ni3+/Ni2+ endowed the stable catalytic activity of NiCo2O4 nanosheet. Interestingly, developed NiCo2O4-1/PMS oxidation system could achieve the effective degradation of antibiotics with high concentration in a short time. Both radical and nonradical pathways were involved into PMS activation, wherein SO4−[rad], [rad]OH, O2−[rad] and 1O2 were major reactive oxygen species. The formation paths of reactive oxygen species and effects of inorganic anions were also investigated. Electrochemical analyses revealed that NiCo2O4-1 with nanosheet structure mediated the electron transfer between PMS and tetracycline (TC), which played a vital role in TC degradation. Furthermore, developed NiCo2O4-1/PMS oxidation system displayed great removal ability towards TC in actual water samples, and degradation products were low toxicity or no toxicity. In short, current work not only developed an effective oxidation system for completing the rapid degradation of antibiotic with high concentration, but also shared some novel insights into the activation mechanism of SR-AOPs.",Chemosphere
Modulating eg orbitals through ligand engineering to boost the electrocatalytic activity of NiSe for advanced lithium-sulfur batteries,"© 2022 Science Press and Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of SciencesAccelerating the sluggish redox kinetics of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) by electrocatalysis is essential to achieve high performance lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries. However, the issue of insufficient catalytic activity remains to be addressed. Herein, a strategy of modulating eg orbitals through ligand engineering has been proposed to boost the catalytic activity of NiSe for rapid LiPSs redox conversion. The X-ray spectroscopic measurements and theoretical calculations reveal that partial substitution of Se with N disrupts the octahedral coordination of Ni atoms in NiSe, leading to the reduced degeneracy and upward shift of eg orbitals of Ni 3d states. As a consequence, the bonding strength of N-substituted NiSe (N-NiSe) with LiPSs is enhanced, which facilitates the interfacial charge transfer kinetics and accelerates the LiPSs redox kinetics. Therefore, the Li-S batteries assembled with N-NiSe present a high capacity of 682.6 mAh g−1 at a high rate of 5 C and a high areal capacity of 6.5 mAh cm−2 at a high sulfur loading of 6 mg cm−2. This work provides a promising strategy to develop efficient transition-metal based electrocatalysts for Li-S batteries through eg orbital modulation.",Journal of Energy Chemistry
Cu-doped CaFeO3 perovskite oxide as oxygen reduction catalyst in air cathode microbial fuel cells,"© 2022 Elsevier Inc.Cathode electrocatalyst is quite critical to realize the application of microbial fuel cells (MFCs). Perovskite oxides have been considered as potential MFCs cathode catalysts to replace Pt/C. Herein, Cu-doped perovskite oxide with a stable porous structure and excellent conductivity was successfully prepared through a sol-gel method. Due to the incorporation of Cu, CaFe0.9Cu0.1O3 has more micropores and a larger surface area, which are more conducive to contact with oxygen. Doping Cu resulted in more Fe3+ in B-site and thus enhanced its binding capability to oxygen molecules. The data from electrochemical test demonstrated that the as-prepared catalyst has good conductivity, high stability, and excellent ORR properties. Compared with Pt/C catalyst, CaFe0.9Cu0.1O3 exhibits a lower overpotential, which had an onset potential of 0.195 V and a half-wave potential of −0.224 V, respectively. CaFe0.9Cu0.1O3 displays an outstanding four-electron pathway for ORR mechanism and demonstrates superiors corrosion resistance and stability. The MFC with CaFe0.9Cu0.1O3 has a greater maximum power density (1090 mW m−3) rather than that of Pt/C cathode (970 mW m−3). This work demonstrated CaFe0.9Cu0.1O3 is an economic and efficient cathodic catalyst for MFCs.",Environmental Research
Catalysts containing Fe and Mn from dewatered sludge showing enhanced electrocatalytic degradation of triclosan,"© 2022 Elsevier Inc.The present work demonstrates a simple one-step pyrolysis method for the synthesis of a catalytic sludge-based carbon (SBC) biochar containing Fe and Mn from dehydrated sludge with added KMnO4 and Fe(II). The electrocatalytic degradation of triclosan (TCS) in water was evaluated using an Fe/Mn-SBC cathode to promote a heterogeneous Fenton-like reaction. The catalyst generated at 500 °C exhibited an abundant porous structure and a relatively high surface area, and produced an electrode with better conductivity and electron diffusion. The presence of metal oxides changed the surface structure defects of this biochar and enhanced its catalytic performance while increasing the electrochemically active surface area by 72.68 mF/cm2 compared with plain SBC. TCS was degraded (91.3%) within 180 min by oxygen species generated in situ on an Fe/Mn-SBC cathode because the activation energy for oxygen reduction was lowered by 4.62 kJ/mol. The degradation of TCS followed pseudo first-order kinetics and was controlled by TCS diffusion and interfacial chemical reactions between adsorbed TCS and the electrode. Possible TCS degradation pathways were devised based on the main intermediates, and 1O2 was found to be more important than •OH radicals. Through toxicity test and prediction, the toxicity of degradation was gradually reduced. This study demonstrates a simple and ecofriendly method for the electrocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants.",Environmental Research
Highly efficient peroxymonosulfate activation of single-atom Fe catalysts via integration with Fe ultrafine atomic clusters for the degradation of organic contaminants,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Recently, Fe single-atom catalysts activating peroxymonosulfate (PMS) have been of great potential to degrade recalcitrant organic pollutants. However, the mechanism of the unfavorable metal agglomerates produced throughout high-temperature pyrolysis on the Fenton-like reaction still remains confused. Herein, an efficient and stable catalyst integrating Fe single atoms with ultrafine atomic clusters (FeUAC@FeSA-NC) was successfully synthesized. The FeUAC@FeSA-NC/PMS system exhibited nearly 100% sulfamethoxazole (SMX) decomposition performance over a broad range of pH 3.0–9.0. Considering the difference in SMX degradation rate with or without Fe ultrafine atomic clusters, the catalytic performance of leached Fe ions, and the permissible Fe leaching concentration, it was not necessary to acid leach the FeUAC@FeSA-NC catalyst before use. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations manifested that the isolated Fe single-atom site neighbored by ultrafine atomic clusters acted as the optimal active site for PMS activation, and simultaneously the pyrrolic N served as the SMX adsorption site. The reactive species, including 1O2, [rad]O2−, SO4−[rad] and [rad]OH radicals and activated metal-peroxo species (Fe-PMS*), played the key role in FeUAC@FeSA-NC/PMS system. The satisfactory SMX removal efficiency and mineralization rate in actual wastewater imply that this efficient heterogeneous catalytic PMS system is a promising approach for sustainable wastewater reclamation applications.",Separation and Purification Technology

XPS was conducted to examine the surface composition and electronic structure changes of the CNT-Pd catalyst before and after gas treatment. The XPS results revealed that as-prepared CNT-Pd contains at least two different oxidation states on the surface, whereon their proportions depend on the gas used for treatment. Treatment with H2 leads to Pd(0) enrichment near the surface, while O2 treatment causes Pd(Ⅱ) enrichment of CNT-Pd. All catalysts containing both Pd(0) and Pd(Ⅱ) were active toward H2O2 reduction, and the Heck cross-coupling reaction of n-butyl acrylate and 4-iodotoluene; increased proportion of metallic Pd(0) boosted the catalytic reaction. However, the catalyst stability increased as the amount of Pd(II) increased.",Chemosphere
Quick evolution of edge-shared metal-oxygen octahedrons for boosting acidic water oxidation,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdExploring highly durable and active electrocatalysts for water oxidation in acidic electrolytes remains a great challenge, because of the easy dissolution of active sites under harsh working conditions. Maintaining the coordination structure of active sites in the process of acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) to resist local active sites dissolution is theoretically viable, but rarely reported. Here, a new type of iridium-based oxide Cr-SrIrO3 with body-centered cubic structure (BCC-Cr-SrIrO3) is designed for boosting acidic-OER. Thanks to this unique atomic structure, an amorphous layer of CrIrOx with edge-shared CrOx and IrOx octahedrons was in situ formed by quick leaching of only Sr over BCC-Cr-SrIrO3 during the OER process. The edge-shared metal-oxygen octahedrons act as a tunable catalytic platform to optimize the acidic-OER, where the electron synergistic coupling effect between bimetallic octahedrons improves the OER activity by tens of times per iridium site with a mass activity of 417.6 A gIr−1 at 0.3 V overpotential; while the strong coordination persistence of iridium sites in the edge-shared octahedrons under working potentials dictates superior durability with a large stability number of 7 × 105 in 0.1 M HClO4. This study promises a new route for the design of superior iridium-based acidic-OER catalysts.",Nano Energy
The Role of Hydroxide Binding Energy in Alkaline Hydrogen Oxidation Reaction Kinetics on RuCr Nanosheet†,"© 2022 SIOC, CAS, Shanghai, & WILEY-VCH GmbH.Unveiling the role of adsorbed hydroxide involved in the hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) under alkaline electrolyte is crucial for the development of advanced HOR electrocatalysts for the alkaline polymer electrolyte fuel cells (APEFCs). Herein, we report the synthesis of amorphous RuCr nanosheets with different molar ratios and their HOR performances under alkaline media. We find a volcano correlation between the Cr content in RuCr nanosheets and their alkaline HOR performance. Experimental results and density functional theory (DFT) calculation reveals that the optimized Cr content in RuCr nanosheets could lead to the optimum hydroxide binding energy (OHBE), contributes to their remarkable alkaline HOR performance with mass activity of 568.1 A·gPGM–1 at 50 mV, 13-fold higher than that of Ru catalyst. When RuCr nanosheet is further used as the anodic electrocatalyst, a peak power density of 1.04 W·cm–2 can be achieved in an APEFC.",Chinese Journal of Chemistry
Mechanistic and structure investigation of the KOH activation ZIF-8 derived porous carbon as metal-free for unprecedented peroxymonosulfate activation degradation of bisphenol A,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdThe high-performance and free secondary pollution of the catalysts are the most critical issues in the peroxymonosulfate-based advanced oxidation processes (PMS-AOPs). In this research, the KOH was used to activate ZIF-8 derived carbon materials to synthesize the NC-KOH-x (x = 700, 800, 900 °C), which was an effective metal-free PMS activator. As-prepared NC-KOH-x showed significant improvement not only pore structure and BET surface area but also C[dbnd]O groups, and graphite N content, which were beneficial for the adsorptive and oxidative reaction. The NC-KOH-900 as an excellent metal-free carbon-catalyst exhibited considerable reactivity for bisphenol A (BPA) removal in broad pH ranges. Almost 100% of BPA was eliminated using 9 mg NC-KOH-900, 0.5 mM PMS within 60 min. Interestingly, It was found that the BPA removal efficiency by adding PMS after saturated adsorption of NC-KOH-x was better than that by adding NC-KOH-x and PMS simultaneously. Electronic paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and quenching experiments results demonstrated that the BPA degradation relied mainly on the nonradical (1O2) pathways and the defects (ID/IG), graphitic nitrogen, pyridinic nitrogen, and C[dbnd]O were verified as leading catalytic sites for BPA degradation via PMS activation. Finally, degradation pathways of BPA were proposed and the Toxicity Estimation Software Tool (T.E.S.T.) result implicated that the intermediates of BPA were environmentally friendly to the microorganism and recycled in the ecosystem. The outcomes of this study illustrated the NC-KOH-x owned many merits of state-of-the-art, eco-friendly, and high-performance for great potential practical application value.",Chemosphere
Architecture of bimetallic-MOF/silicate derived Co/NC@mSiO2 as peroxymonosulfate activator for highly efficient ciprofloxacin degradation,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Bimetallic-ZIF@silicate derived Co/NC@mSiO2 hollow sphere was developed as an excellent peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activator for ciprofloxacin (CFL) antibiotic and parabens degradation. First, bimetallic Zn-Co/ZIF frameworks were prepared by a solvothermal method and then coated with a silica layer. Subsequently, Zn-Co/ZIF@mSiO2 was carbonized under nitrogen gas to obtain the Co, N co-doped porous carbon material. The evaporation of zinc metal in Zn-Co/ZIF@mSiO2 by inert gas flow played an important role in the formation of porous carbon material. In the presence of a small quantity of PMS, this hollow sphere material acts as a highly efficient catalyst for the degradation of CFL with a rate constant of 0.07 min−1. The findings obtained from the quenching radical test and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) reveal that Co site within the hollow sphere nanoreactor catalyzed PMS to the generation of the HO[rad], SO4[rad]−, and 1O2 for CFL degradation. Notably, the presence of Co NPs in the hollow sphere material enables the facile separation of the catalyst from the reaction mixtures using an external magnet. Furthermore, the as-prepared catalysts exhibited antibacterial activity in Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus). The current study provides new horizons to develop ZIF-derived hybrid hollow materials in eliminating organic pollutants.",Separation and Purification Technology
Enhanced catalytic oxidation of toluene over manganese-based multi-metal oxides synthesized by ozone driving redox reaction,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.A series of heteroatom-doped MnO2 have been successfully synthesized by the ozone driving redox reaction, wherein the Fe, Co, Ni and Cu were directly introduced into MnO2. It was inferred that the doped heteroatoms existed in the form of Fe2+, Fe3+, Fe4+, Co3+, Ni3+, Cu2+ and Cu3+ in MnO2 by the characterization of XRD, XPS, Raman and HRTEM. Their catalytic activities of toluene oxidation were positively correlated with the molar ratios of (Mn2++Mn3+)/Mn4+, the proportion of adsorbed oxygen species and the low-temperature reducibility. The larger radius of high-valence Fe ions led to obvious structural distortion of MnO2, which brought about more active oxygen species on the surface of the most active Fe-MnO2. According to BET and SEM characterization, the high specific surface area and nanostructure should contribute to the high activity of Fe-MnO2. In addition, the in-situ DRIFTS confirmed that the first functional group adsorbed on the surface of Fe-MnO2 was the methyl group, and thus toluene was oxidized to some carbonyl-containing species. TD/GC–MS detection showed that the organic compounds existed in the exhaust gas. Ultimately, the catalytic mechanism and the degradation of toluene oxidation were also discussed.",Separation and Purification Technology
Combining molybdenum carbide with ceria overlayers to boost Mo/CeO2 catalyzed ammonia synthesis,"© 2022 American Institute of Chemical Engineers.The design of an efficient non-noble metal catalyst is of burgeoning interest for ammonia synthesis. Herein, we report a Mo2C/CeO2 catalyst that is superior in ammonia synthesis activity. In this catalyst, molybdenum carbide coexisted with the ceria overlayers which is from the ceria support as the strong metal–support interaction. There is a high proportion of low-valent Mo species, as well as high concentration of Ce3+ and surface oxygen species. The presence of Mo2C and CeO2 overlayers not only leads to enhancement of hydrogen and nitrogen adsorption, but also facilitates the desorption and exchange of adsorbed species with the gaseous reagents. Compared with the Mo/CeO2 catalyst prepared without carbonization, the Mo2C/CeO2 catalyst is more than sevenfold higher in ammonia synthesis rate. This work not only presents an explicit example of designing Mo-based catalyst that is highly efficient for ammonia synthesis by tuning the adsorption and desorption properties of the reactant gases, but opens a perspective for other elements in ammonia synthesis.",AIChE Journal
Promoting surface reconstruction of NiFe layered double hydroxides via intercalating [Cr(C2O4)3]3− for enhanced oxygen evolution,"© 2022 Science Press and Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of SciencesRationally manipulating surface reconstruction of catalysts for water oxidation, inducing formation and dynamic accumulation of catalytically active centers still face numerous challenges. Herein, the introduction of [Cr(C2O4)3]3− into NiFe LDHs by intercalation engineering to promote surface reconstruction achieves an advanced oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity. In view of the weak electronegativity of Cr3+ in [Cr(C2O4)3]3−, the intercalation of [Cr(C2O4)3]3− is expected to result in an electron-rich structure of Fe sites in NiFe LDHs, and higher valence state of Ni can be formed with the charge transfer between Fe and Ni. The optimized electronic structure of NiFe-[Cr(C2O4)3]3−-LDHs with more active Ni3+ species and the expedited dynamic generation of Ni3+(Fe)OOH phase during the OER process contributed to its excellent catalytic property, revealed by in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and quasi-in situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. With the modulated electronic structure of metal sites, NiFe-[Cr(C2O4)3]3−-LDHs exhibited promoted OER property with a lower overpotential of 236 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm−2. This work illustrates the intercalation of conjugated anion to dynamically construct desired Ni3+ sites with the optimal electronic environment for improved OER electrocatalysis.",Journal of Energy Chemistry
"N, S dual doped mesoporous carbon assisted simultaneous electrochemical assay of emerging water contaminant hydroquinone and catechol","© 2022 Elsevier LtdHeteroatom doped mesoporous carbon materials are promising catalysts for the electrochemical sensing application. Herein, we report highly efficient dual heteroatom-doped hexagonal mesoporous carbon (MC) derived from Santa Barbara Amorphous-15 (SBA-15) hard template for the detection of phenolic isomers. The synthesis involves dopamine hydrochloride (DA)/thiophene complex, which helps to attain perfectly retained N and S dual doped mesoporous carbon (NS-MC) framework. NS-MC exhibits higher surface area (951 m2 g−1) as well as higher pore volume (0.12 cm3 g−1) with huge graphitic, pyridinic and thiophenic defective sites which facilitates the well-resolved simultaneous electrochemical detection of phenolic isomers hydroquinone (HQ) and catechol (CC). Our results demonstrate that as-synthesized NS-MC material had a LOD of 0.63 μM and 0.29 μM for HQ and CC, respectively. From the calibration curve, sensitivities of proposed sensor were found to be 9.44, 2.71 μA μM−1 cm−2 and 20.80, 10.02 μA μM−1 cm−2 for HQ and CC, respectively with good linear ranges of 10–45 μM and 45–115 μM for HQ; 2–16 μM and 16–40 μM for CC. The NS-MC modified electrode exhibited good selectivity over various possible interferences. The present investigation reveals that the proposed NS-MC material is a promising metal-free catalyst which boosted to electrochemically detect both HQ and CC, present in the municipal tap as well as natural river stream water samples.",Chemosphere
A BiPb bimetallic electrode for highly selective CO2 conversion to formate,"© 2022Electrochemical CO2 reduction technology can chemically transfer carbon dioxide into high value-added chemicals and fuels by utilizing renewable energy. However, it still needs more exploration of electrocatalysts with high activity, superior selectivity, and excellent durability in converting CO2 to storable carbon-based liquid fuels. Herein, we develop a BiPb bimetallic electrode with metal Bi and alloy Pb7Bi3 crystalline phase by a pulse-electrodeposition method with multiple cycles. The prepared BiPb electrode can generate a high catalytic selectivity and activity for the electroreduction CO2 to formate with good current density (15.56 mA cm−2) at −0.96 V vs RHE and desired long-term durability. The BiPb has higher formate ECSA-normalized partial current densities than single Bi and Pb at the whole potential range, suggesting that it possesses higher intrinsic activity and selectivity toward formate production. Furthermore, during the long-term test, the crystalline phase of the BiPb electrode would transform from metal Bi and Pb7Bi3 into Bi2O2CO3 because the BiPb is exposed in CO2-rich 0.5 M KHCO3 electrolyte at −0.96 V vs. RHE. This work may arouse worthy interests in mixed crystals of the bimetallic electrode to achieve efficient electrocatalysts for selective CO2 conversion toward the generation of valuable carbon-based chemicals.",Separation and Purification Technology
"Electrochemical degradation of antibiotic enoxacin using a novel PbO2 electrode with a graphene nanoplatelets inter-layer: Characteristics, efficiency and mechanism","© 2022 Elsevier LtdA novel PbO2 electrode was fabricated by adding graphene nanoplatelets (GNP) inter-layer into β-PbO2 active layer (called GNP-PbO2) and utilized to degradation of antibiotic enoxacin (ENO). The GNP-PbO2 electrode had a much rougher surface than the typical PbO2 electrode, with smaller crystal size and lower charge-transfer resistance at the electrode/electrolyte interface. Notably, the GNP inter-layer increased the oxygen evolution potential of PbO2 electrode (2.05 V vs. SCE), which was very beneficial to inhibit oxygen evolution and promote ·OH production. The relatively best operating parameters for ENO removal and energy efficiency were current density of 20 mA cm−2, initial pH of 7, initial ENO concentration of 100 mg L−1 and electrode distance of 4 cm. Furthermore, indirect radical oxidation was found to be the main way during electrolysis process. Based on the observed analysis of intermediate products, the main reaction pathways of ENO included hydroxylation, defluorination and piperazine ring-opening. Finally, combinating with the electro-oxidation capability, stability and safety evaluation, we can conclude that GNP-PbO2 is a promising anode for treatment of various organic pollutants in wastewater.",Chemosphere

Experimental and calculation results confirm that alloying of Ni-Co and nitrogen doping to carbon enhances the rate-determining transformation of *OH intermediate during ORR. The Ni/Co@NC hence shows an ORR activity comparable with the commercial Pt/C.",Journal of Energy Chemistry
Ultrasonic-assisted enhancement of lithium-oxygen battery,"© 2022Lithium-oxygen batteries have attracted much attention due to their high theoretical specific capacity, but their high overpotential and poor cyclic stability limit further development. These are usually closely related to the reversible reactions of the formation and decomposition of the discharge product Li2O2. This study presents the feasibility of ultrasonic-assisted enhancement of lithium-oxygen battery performance. Under the application of ultrasonic charging with 5:5 duty cycle and 675 W power, the rapid upward trend of charging voltage can be effectively suppressed, and the original overpotential of the lithium-oxygen battery can be reduced by 25.9%. In addition, at a limited specific capacity of 400 mAh g−1 and a current density of 800 mA g−1, when applying ultrasonic charging process with above ultrasonic condition every 20 cycles, the cycle life of lithium-oxygen battery with Co3O4 as the positive electrode can reach 321 cycles. Ultrasonic charging has positive effects on suppressing concentration polarization, enhancing mass transfer, and improving oxygen evolution reaction kinetics. It can effectively promote the rapid decomposition of the discharge product Li2O2, reduce the overpotential, and improve the battery cycle performance and stability.",Nano Energy
Single crystalline manganite (γ‒MnOOH) rods enclosed with high index facets and its excellent catalytic conversion of lignin‒derived feedstock,"© 2022 Elsevier Inc.Single crystalline manganite (γ‒MnOOH) materials with rod shape have been synthesized via hydrothermal method. Interestingly, the extent of the hydrothermal duration of the syntheses had a significant impact on the crystal's growth of manganite rather than morphogical or phase tuning. Hydrothermal duration and amount of SDS had a significant impact on the crystal's growth. During synthesis, SDS template preferentially bind on the (111) than (101) surface. The rod shaped manganite has been identified by powder X‒ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, high‒resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), field‒emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), and X‒ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) studies. PXRD and HR TEM techniques were shown that the rod shaped manganite are single crystalline in nature. FESEM, HRTEM and SAED techniques revealed that the rod shaped manganite were enclosed with {11‒1}, {‒111}, {111} and {110} exposed facets. XPS analysis revealed that Mn exhibits a mixed‒valence state (Mn3+ and Mn4+) at the surface of the rods.

Mechanically induced Cu active sites for selective C-C coupling in CO2 electroreduction,"© 2022 Science Press and Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of SciencesDeveloping a convenient method to endow bulk Cu-based electrode with high activity of electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) to multicarbon (C2+) products is desirable but challenging. Herein, for the first time, we report that mechanical polishing induces highly reactive Cu sites for selective C-C coupling in CO2RR. We find that mechanical polishing could endow Cu foil with abundant nanocavity surface structure, which efficiently confines the carbonaceous intermediates to enhance the probability of C-C coupling reaction. By confining the carbonaceous intermediates with Cu nanocavity, the as-prepared electrode delivers a Faradaic efficiency toward C2+ products of 65.7 % at −1.3 V vs. RHE, which is enhanced up to 1.7 folds compared with that of commercial Cu foil.

"Benchmarking the two-dimensional conductive Y3(C6X6)2 (Y = Co, Cu, Pd, Pt; X = NH, NHS, S) metal-organic framework nanosheets for CO2 reduction reaction with tunable performance","© 2022Scrutinizing competent and economical electrocatalysts for carbon-di-oxide reduction reactions (CO2RR) is essential for wide-range commercialization of livestock feed. Therefore, via density functional theory (DFT), we broadly explored the electrocatalytic performance of two-dimensional (2D) metal−organic frameworks (Y3(C6X6)2), where Y indicates Co, Cu, Pd, Pt; and X indicates organic ligands; (NH, NHS, S) for CO2RR. The 2D Y3(C6X6)2 monolayers unveiled metallic behavior due to the suitable π electron conjugation network and the productive interaction among the metal atom, organic ligands, and benzene rings, except for Co3(C6S6)2, which revealed semiconducting behavior. Significantly, the catalytic performance of Y3(C6X6)2 is influenced by the strength of interaction between the CO2RR intermediates and the metal complex (Y-X4), which may be altered by varying the central metal atom with different d-electron orbitals or by organic ligands. Surprisingly, Co3(C6(NH)3S3)2, Co3(C6(NH)3)2, and Cu3(C6S6)2 have excellent CO2RR to formic acid activity. Whereas, Pt3(C6(NH)3)2 and Pd3(C6(NH)3)2 shows good CO2RR to carbon mono-oxide activity. Our research provides imperative insights for designing and screening efficient CO2RR catalysts. This research put forward the idea of developing metal-organic frameworks with beneficial properties to meet the specific requirements of diverse research areas, such as catalysis, energy storage, and molecular sensing.",Fuel Processing Technology

Promotion of formaldehyde degradation by electro-Fenton: Controlling the distribution of ·OH and formaldehyde near cathode to increase the reaction probability,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdThe mismatch of pollutant concentration and ·OH concentration is the key reason for the inefficient degradation of formaldehyde in the electro-Fenton system. Therefore, formaldehyde and ·OH are adsorbed near the cathode, and the high concentration reaction region is constructed to increase the reaction probability, which is called control of the reaction region. Through nitrogen doping modification of the activated carbon cathode, the adsorption capacity of the modified cathode for formaldehyde and active species, and the selectivity of the two-electron oxygen reduction reaction were deeply analyzed. The results show that the suitable nitrogen doping form of the modified cathode significantly promotes the adsorption capacity of formaldehyde and H2O2, which is beneficial to realizing the promotion of formaldehyde degradation by nitrogen doped cathodes in the electro-Fenton system through control of the reaction region. Graphite nitrogen and pyrrolic nitrogen improve formaldehyde adsorption by enhancing the van der Waals force (8.897 mg g−1), and pyridinic nitrogen improve H2O2 adsorption (1.841 mg g−1) by enhancing the effect of hydrogen bonding interaction. Nitrogen doping enhances Fe2+ regeneration, which contributes to the generation of ·OH at the cathode, and promotes formaldehyde degradation. The control of the reaction region through modification of the electro-Fenton cathode achieved formaldehyde degradation of 35.1 mg L−1 (48.51% higher than that of the unmodified cathode), which provides a promising process for formaldehyde treatment.",Chemosphere
Understanding the surface segregation behavior of bimetallic CoCu toward HMF oxidation reaction,"© 2022 Science Press and Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of SciencesSurface segregation is ubiquitous in multi-component materials and is of great important for catalysis but little is known on the surface structure under graphene encapsulation. Here, we show that the graphene encapsulated CoCu performs well for the electrocatalytic oxidation of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) to 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) with the onset potential before 1.23 VRHE and a nearly 100% selectivity of FDCA under 1.4 VRHE. From the experimental results, the unprecedented catalytic performance was attributed to local structural distortion and sub-nanometer lattice composition of the CoCu surface. We accurately show the dispersed Cu doped Co3O4 nano-islands with a lot of edge sites on the bimetallic Co-Cu surface. While, the gradient components effectively facilitate the establishment of built-in electric field and accelerate the charge transfer.

Preparation of renewable porous carbons for CO2 capture – A review,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.A diversity of renewable wastes such as biomass and plastic can be employed for the synthesis of porous carbons, which have emerged as promising materials for CO2 capture under a wide range of conditions owing to their unique properties. Because of limited review articles in this field, this paper provided the recent progress and significant challenges in the synthesis of renewable porous carbons for CO2 capture with the objective of guiding future works on the CO2 abatement technologies towards a sustainable direction. Among the post-consumer plastics, PET has been widely used for the synthesis of porous carbons for effective CO2 capture because of its high carbon and oxygen content. In general, porous carbons derived from waste biomass and plastic are quite attractive for CO2 capture due to their tunable textural properties, simple synthesis methods and high CO2 adsorption capacities, which are closely associated with the structures and properties of porous carbons (e.g., microporous structure, heteroatoms doping). Particularly, the doped N species (e.g., pyridinic-N, pyrrolic-N) can transform the electronic state of the H atoms in the –CH and –NH groups on porous carbons to form hydrogen bonds between H and the O atom of CO2 molecule, thus for enhancing the CO2 adsorption.",Fuel Processing Technology
Direct photo-curing 3D printing of nickel-based electrocatalysts for highly-efficient hydrogen evolution,"© 2022It is of great significance to develop cost-effective electrocatalysts for efficient and durable hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alkaline media to meet the increasing demand of hydrogen.

DFT study of small Re-Pt clusters supported on γ-Al2O3,"© 2022The scarcity and high cost of raw materials such as platinum to synthesize catalysts, makes it desirable to reduce the amount of precious metal used preserving their overall catalytic performance. A promising solution to this is for example, using highly dispersed and catalytically active transition metal clusters supported on metal oxides, such as TiO2, CeO2, and γ-Al2O3. Thus, bimetallic clusters can potentially offer additional catalytic enhancement due to a synergy between the involved metal atoms. We focus our attention on a computational, DFT study of small bimetallic Re-Pt clusters supported on γ-Al2O3. We aim to determine global minima configurations of Re-Pt clusters (up to 5 atoms) on the γ-Al2O3 (100) surface by using a Basin Hopping global optimization scheme. The adsorption and mixing energies are calculated as a function of clusters size and composition, thus providing a quantifiable picture of the stability of such bimetallic clusters. Our results show that bimetallic Re-Pt supported clusters exhibit higher stability compared to monometallic Re or Pt clusters. Regarding the bonding mechanism between metal clusters and the oxide substrate, our calculations indicate that the contribution to the PDOS of the 6-s states of both Re and Pt atoms is negligible, compared to that of the 5s-states. Furthermore, projected density of states (PDOS) analysis indicate that no bond is formed between the surface Al atoms and clusters. A Bader charge transfer analysis reveals that Re-rich clusters transfer electrons to the γ-Al2O3 substrate, while the opposite is true for their Pt-rich counterparts. Finally, various cluster nucleation pathways are investigated finding that the most favorable nucleation routes lead to the Re3Pt2 and Re5 clusters, while the coalescence of Pt atoms into Pt clusters is energetically unfavorable.",Surface Science
Coordination environment of Ru clusters with in-situ generated metastable symmetry-breaking centers for seawater electrolysis,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdSeawater electrolysis offers hope for renewable production of green hydrogen. However, its hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is quite difficulty due to electrode corrosion and undesirable side reactions. More importantly, it is still a big challenge to regulate charge distribution of Ru clusters at atomic level for maximizing the activity. Herein, theory calculations unveil that, substituting partial Ru atoms with atomically dispersedly nonstoichiometric CdySex drives in-situ generation of metastable symmetry-breaking Ru cluster surfaces (Ru/CdySex) and more atom vacancies, which regulates the coordination environment of Ru atoms and results in optimized Ru−H bond and more channels for H migration. As expected, Ru/Cd0.02Se4 requires overpotentials as low as 4.2 and 6.3 mV at 10 mA cm−2, and has 8.1 and 9.6 times higher turnover frequency (TOF) than Ru/Sex in alkali and alkaline seawater, respectively, superior to Pt/C and most other catalysts reported so far. Also, it shows very impressive stability over 50 h.

A combined QTAIM/IRI topological analysis of the effect of axial/equatorial positions of NH2 and CN substituents in the [(PY5Me2)MoO]+ complex,"© 2022 Elsevier Inc.By means of the Interaction Region Indicator (IRI) and Quantum Theory of Atoms in Molecules (QTAIM), the influence exerted by NH2 (amino) and CN (cyano) as electron donor and electron acceptor substituent groups, respectively, located at para–positions of axial and equatorial pyridine rings of derivatized complexes coming from the [(PY5Me2)MoO]+ complex during the hydrogen molecular release in the gas phase was analyzed. In any case, a H–H covalent bond is forming at the transition state, with a strengthening of the electron density of 5.5% when the substituent group involved is NH2 at the para–position of the axial pyridine ring. However, there was no difference between NH2 and CN when these substituent groups are located at the para–positions of the equatorial pyridine rings. The topological properties of electron densities from the QTAIM are not perturbed by the electron donor and electron acceptor nature of the substituents, even when these substituent groups are located at the axial or equatorial pyridine rings of the Mo–based complex.",Journal of Molecular Graphics and Modelling
The role of carbon dots in the life cycle of crops,"© 2022The novel 0-dimensional quasi-spherical fluorescent carbon dots (diameter <10 nm) have the characteristics of small size, adjustable emission wavelength range, easy functional modification of surface groups, and good biocompatibility. Studies showed that it has great application potential in the entire life cycle of crops, including pre-harvest and post-harvest. Subsequently, crop waste can be used to prepare carbon dots and re-enter the crop life cycle. This review summarizes recent studies showing that carbon dots with specific chemical or optical properties can enhance crop yields in different ways. The small size and surface hydrophilic groups that can cross the plant cell barrier are beneficial to CDs to promote seed germination and absorb nutrients to promote growth. The high carbon content (>60%) endows it with potential as a nano-carbon fertilizer. CDs with positive surface charges or prepared by medium molecular weight PEI are the key to targeted delivery of fertilizers, pesticides, fungicides, DNA or RNA. The luminescence range of CDs covers the absorption range of plants and the electron donor and acceptor properties promote plant photosynthesis. The antioxidant properties of CDs are crucial for improving crop stress resistance. Photodynamic, photothermal, and UV absorption properties endow CDs with antibacterial and preservation applications. Finally, current challenges and future prospects are discussed.",Industrial Crops and Products
"A comprehensive study on heterogeneous single atom catalysis: Current progress, and challenges☆","© 2022 Elsevier B.V.The production of suitable catalytic materials has expanded considerably in recent years. Now a days, single atom catalysts (SACs) are becoming a new fundamental research area because of the availability of a greater number of active sites and high catalytic activity. However, when particle size decreases, the surface activity of metals upsurges, facilitating the aggregation and sintering. As a result, an appropriate strategy is necessary for the synthesis and stability of SACs. Meanwhile, a large quantity of catalysts is needed for industrial scale production and practical applications. Therefore, manufacturing a high yield of SACs remains challenging. The development of bimetallic SACs is crucial since bimetallic and ternary catalysts have become more comprehended. Herein, the review opens a broad portfolio towards the development of SACs in the fields of electrocatalysis (HER, OER, ORR, N2 reduction, CO oxidation etc.), photocatalysis (H2 generation, CO2 reduction etc.) and organic transformation (C[sbnd]C, C[sbnd]X bond formation, oxidation of alcohol-aldehyde and alkane-alcohol) focusing on different types of metal-support co-ordination. A comprehensive summary of the different synthesis protocols of SACs (impregnation, co-precipitation, ALD, pyrolysis, etc.) over several substrates and large-scale manufacturing strategies are highlighted. Furthermore, the current review will concentrate on SAC stability, dual site performance, and the growth of bimetallic SACs to date. Finally, the potential future opportunities are discussed.",Coordination Chemistry Reviews
Benzenehexol-based 2D MOF as high-performance electrocatalyst for oxygen reduction reaction,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Two-dimensional (2D) conductive metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) were an emerging class of potential oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) electrocatalysts to replace platinum-containing electrode materials. Herein, by first-principles calculations, we systematically studied the structural stability, electronic properties and ORR catalytic activity of metal-hexahydroxybenzene nanosheets, M3(C6O6), M = 3d and 4d transition metals. Based on formation energy, phonon spectrum and ab-initio molecular dynamics analyses, eight monolayer M3(C6O6) (M = Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Cu, Zn, Ru and Rh) show superior thermodynamic, kinetic and thermal stabilities. Further ORR catalytic activity evaluation shown Cu3(C6O6) and Rh3(C6O6) had promising applications in catalyzing ORR 4e- pathway, with limiting potentials 0.76 and 0.80 V, respectively. The linear relationship between integrated crystal orbital Hamilton population (ICOHP) and ΔGOH∗ explains the suitable adsorption energy of OH* on the catalyst, resulting in the excellent ORR activity of Cu3(C6O6) and Rh3(C6O6).

Metal-free boron doped g-C3N5 catalyst: Efficient doping regulatory strategy for photocatalytic water splitting,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.As a promising strategy for addressing the energy shortage, photocatalytic overall water splitting (POWS) is usually restricted by two fatal drawbacks of photocatalyst: the conflict between high utilization of solar and strong redox ability of photogenerated electrons and holes; and the fast recombination of charge carriers. Herein, we introduce the single boron atom into g-C3N5 by the density functional theory simulation to overcome the abovementioned dilemma and obtain a suitable catalyst for POWS. Based on the effective mass theory (EMT), we regulate the levels of impurity states by adjusting the doping site. Two doping types from 18 doping models are screened out to meet the needs of POWS. On the one hand, the suitable impurity levels induced by skillfully designed boron doping not only extend the light absorption range from ultraviolet to visible light region, but also ensure the driving force of photogenerated electrons and holes for overall water splitting. On the other hand, the impurity states effectively separate the photogenerated electrons and holes spatially. This can suppress the recombination of photogenerated carriers. Our research not only provides a promising photocatalyst for POWS, but also advances the development of the doping strategy.",Applied Surface Science

Effects of surface wettability on (001)-WO3 and (100)-WSe2: A spin-polarized DFT-MD study,"© 2022 The Author(s)An extensive understanding of WO3 and WSe2 bulk crystalline structures and explicit solvent effects on (001)-WO3 and (100)-WSe2 facets are essential for design of efficient (photo) electrocatalysts. The atomistic level understanding of both WO3 and WSe2 bulk solids and how water solvation processes occur on WO3 and WSe2 facets are nowadays characterized by a noticeable lack of knowledge. Herein, forefront Density Functional Theory-based molecular dynamics have been conducted for assessing the role of an explicit water environment in the characterization of solid surfaces. Water at the interface and H-bonds environment, as well as WO3 and WSe2 surface activity, will be described in terms of surface wettability and interfacial water dynamics, revealing the relevance of treating explicitly liquid water and its dynamics in assessing catalytic features. We provide pieces of evidence of the hydrophobic character shown by (001)-WO3 and (100)-WSe2 facets. A preferential in-plane hydration structure of the first water layer has been detected at both (001)-WO3 and (100)-WSe2 water interface, in which the electric dipole moment of water molecules is re-oriented in a sort of 2-dimensional H-bond network.

Here, the composite of cobalt molybdenum phosphide nanoparticles embedded in crosslinked nitrogen-doped carbon nanofiber (Co0.4Mo0.6P@CL-NCNF) has been synthesized via an electrospinning process and pyrolysis treatment. As an effective hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalyst, the Co0.4Mo0.6P@CL-NCNF only requires the overpotentials of 81 mV and 219 mV at the current densities of 10 mA cm−2 and 20 mA cm−2, respectively. Moreover, the water electrolyzer with the Co0.4Mo0.6P@CL-NCNF as the cathode and anode catalysts requires a cell voltage of 1.59 V to reach a current density of 10 mA cm−2. The Co0.4Mo0.6P@CL-NCNF also achieves the excellent stability up to 24 h for HER, OER and overall water spitting in 1.0 M KOH. The excellent catalytic activity of the Co0.4Mo0.6P@CL-NCNF is benefits from the synergistic effect between components and the crosslinked structure of carbon nanofiber.

Defected NiFe layered double hydroxides on N-doped carbon nanotubes as efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst for rechargeable zinc–air batteries,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Layered double hydroxides (LDHs) are highly active materials for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER); however, they have low activity for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The surface modification by the defects engineering is a great strategy to boost their bifunctionality for rechargeable Zn-air batteries (ZABs). In this work, NiFe LDHs were synthesized varying the composition (Ni:Fe compositions of 1:1, 2:1 and 3:1), and BET surface areas of 262.3, 165.9 and 79.5 m2 g−1 were found. Despite the differences in BET surface areas, the NiFe LDH 3:1 presented higher activity for the OER, and thus, oxygen vacancies (Ov)–type surface defects were introduced to this LDH. This surface engineering decreased the oxygen atomic percentage from 75.25 to 57.4 %, and as result, the resistance to charge transfer drastically decreased due to electronic modifications, which can be rationalized in terms of the theoretical density of states obtained by density functional theory for a model system including oxygen vacancies. The combination between defected NiFe LDH with N-doped carbon nanotubes allowed to obtain the same current density for ORR than benchmarked Pt/C with a potential difference of 95 mV, and better activity for OER (1.46 V @ 10 mA cm−2). In the ZAB, a cell voltage of 1.44 V was achieved with a power density close to 36 mW cm−2, being this power similar to that of Pt/C.",Applied Surface Science
Emerging Electrochemical Sensor Based on Bimetallic AuPt NPs for On-Site Detection of Hydrogen Peroxide Adulteration in Raw Cow Milk,"© 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.A long history about milk adulteration with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is extensively reported worldwide. According to fast degradation of H2O2 in raw cow milk, the detection of H2O2 is very challenging. In this study, a highly sensitive non-enzymatic electrochemical sensor has been developed for detecting H2O2 in adulterated milk. The bimetallic gold-platinum nanoparticles (AuPt NPs) are used as electrocatalysts to selectively enhance electrochemical signal of H2O2. The screen-printed carbon electrode (SPCE) modified with proper Au:Pt molar ratio of AuPt alloy NPs exhibits good electrocatalytic activity toward electro-reduction of H2O2 adulterated in both ultra-high temperature processing (UTH) and raw milk samples. This sensor holds great potential for determination of H2O2 in UHT milk. The good sensitivity and low limit of detection (LOD) are calculated to be 152.9 µA mM−1 cm−2 and 4.8 µM, respectively. In addition, this sensor shows good reproducibility (%RSD < 4%) with long-term stability upon 4 months. Applicability of our sensor coupled with portable electrochemical analyzer-simulator is demonstrated by performing analysis of H2O2 adulteration in raw cow milk sample. The linear response was found in the range of 2.5 to 5000 µM with sensitivity and low LOD of 155.5 µA mM−1 cm−2 and 2.5 µM, respectively. This good sensing efficiency arises from the synergistic electrocatalysis effect of bimetallic AuPt NPs on SPCE surface. This finding provides alternative practical method with high sensitivity for on-site and real-time monitoring of H2O2 adulteration in raw milk.

Ultrafine Fe2C nanocrystals encapsulated in interconnected hollow carbon spheres as ORR electrocatalysts for Alkaline/Neutral Zn − Air batteries,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.The development of high − performance non − noble metal electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) superior to commercial Pt/C in both alkaline and neutral medium is critical for renewable energy technology such as metal − air battery, but remains a great challenge. Herein, hollow spherical framework structure is introduced during the solid − state reaction, enabling the active sites to exist with smaller size and more uniform dispersion. Specifically, a grape − cluster − like ORR catalyst (Fc@Fe − NHCS) is synthesized in which Fe2C nanocrystals and Fe − Nx sites are embedded in carbon layers supported by nitrogen − doped hollow carbon spheres. The resultant Fc@Fe − NHCS exhibits an ORR half − wave potential of 0.85 V in alkaline medium compared to 0.86 V for Pt/C. For neutral ORR, the half − wave potential of Fc@Fe − NHCS is 0.76 V, which is equal to that of Pt/C. Furthermore, Fc@Fe − NHCS demonstrates satisfactory peak power density and open − circuit voltage comparable to Pt/C when utilized as air cathode in self − prepared alkaline and neutral zinc − air batteries (ZABs). The co − action of the spherical framework structure with active sites of Fe2C nanocrystals and Fe − Nx sites ensures excellent ORR electrocatalytic performance, which provides a favorable electrocatalyst for various energy devices including alkaline and neutral ZABs.",Applied Surface Science
Two-dimensional conductive π-conjugated metal-organic frameworks as promising electrocatalysts for highly efficient hydrogen evolution reaction,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Two-dimensional conductive π-conjugated metal-organic frameworks (2D c-MOFs), as a new promising electrocatalytic materials, have spurred great research interests, but the systematic research on the structure-property relationship of c-MOF-based electrocatalysts is scarcely reported. Herein we conduct a first-principles study on the screening of a family of 2D c-MOFs (TM3(HITN)2) as HER electrocatalysts, which are constructed by TM atoms and 2,3,8,9,14,15-hexaiminotrinaphthylene (HITN) functional groups. The data suggests that all these 2D TM3(HITN)2 possess metallic with good conductivity for electrochemical reactions due to their intrinsic π-electron conjugation and sufficient interaction between the TM atoms and the organic linkers. Through the complete computational screening, the Zr3(HITN)2 stands out because of its near-zero ΔG*H value and low activation energy barrier. Moreover, the distinguished HER performance of Zr3(HITN)2 can be attributed to the extremely enhanced electron density derived from the C-2p orbitals near the Fermi level accompanied by the size increase of the tri-dentated aromatic linkers. Hence, this study not only highlights a family of promising 2D c-MOF electrocatalysts toward HER, but also supplies a valuable insight on the design of novel and high-performance c-MOF-based materials for better electrocatalysis.",Applied Surface Science

Hence, developing heteroatom-doped pyridinic N abundant porous carbon materials with large surface area have an extensive effect on oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) for fuel cell and metal-air battery. Herein, high content of pyridinic N porous carbon-supported Co/Co-Nx nanoparticles were synthesized as ORR catalysts by carbonizing complexes of hexamethylenetetramine (HMT) and Co(NO3)2·6H2O with silica template. The HMT-Co@SiO2-900 with high content of pyridinic N, large specific surface area, and porous structure exhibits a more positive half-wave potential (0.85 V) than 20% Pt/C and the outstanding performance oxygen evolution reaction behavior. The low Tafel slope of HMT-Co@SiO2-900 revealed the faster reaction kinetics during ORR. The HMT-Co@SiO2-900 zinc-air battery showed a high excellent cyclic stability in continuous charge/discharge cycles for 420 times at 10 mA/cm2.

Strategic orchestration of MoSe2 microspheres on β-cd functionalized rGO: A sustainable electrocatalyst for detection of rifampicin in real samples,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdThe ill effects of prolonged use of rifamycin antibiotics such as rifampicin accentuates its need for detection in the environment as well as in biological fluids. Antibiotics in water and soil are long-lasting, bio-accumulative, and hazardous to aquatic species as well as human health. To address this issue, a sensing platform has been developed using Molybdenum diselenide (MoSe2) embedded on reduced graphene oxide (rGO) functionalized with β-cyclodextrin (β-cd) polymer. The formation of hybrid composite was validated with X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) with EDX analysis. The formation of microspheres were observed with hexagonal crystal system and P63/mmc space group. Furthermore, the composite was employed to fabricate an efficient electrochemical sensor for detecting the widely used antibiotic, rifampicin (RIF). The results reveal excellent activity of the sensor with a limit of detection (LOD) of 28 nM in a linear working range from 0.019 to 374.5 μM.

Microrods-evolved WO3 nanospheres with enriched oxygen-vacancies anchored on dodecahedronal CoO(Co2+)@carbon as durable catalysts for oxygen reduction/evolution reactions,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Oxygen reduction/evolution reactions (ORR/OER) play the vital roles in energy-conversion devices, especially for Zn-air batteries (ZABs). However, it is always a challenge to explore a stable bifunctional catalyst. Here, WO3-anchored ZIF-67-derived CoO@graphitized carbon is wrapped by a thin carbon-layer to obtain CoO@GC/WO3@CL catalysts. The well-crystallized WO3 nanospheres are evolved from WO3 microrods via an intra-particle maturation. For ORR, the peak-potential of CoO@GC/WO3@CL-800 (800 ℃) (0.81 V vs. RHE) is higher than that of Pt/C (0.79 V). Synergies between WO3 (oxygen vacancies) and CoO (Co2+) improve mass/charge transfer to boost the 4e− pathway. For OER, CoO@GC/WO3@CL-800 has a lower overpotential (330 mV) than RuO2 (490 mV) at 10 mA cm−2. The O2 evolution rate can reach 0.125 mmol s−1 with a high Faraday efficiency of 96.7 %. Cooperation between CoOOH and oxygen vacancies promotes the H2O-oxidation to boost the O2-generation. A relatively low ΔE [Ej=10(OER)-E1/2(ORR)] of 0.72 V confirms the highly-stable ORR/OER activities of CoO@GC/WO3@CL-800, which obtains a higher power density (138 mW cm−2) than Pt/C + RuO2 cathode in primary ZABs. This study indicates a new direction to build a multilayer-structured ORR/OER catalyst by using ZIFs as templates.",Applied Surface Science

Horizontal and vertical stacked Ag/MoS2 nanostructure enabled excellent carrier mobility and optoelectronic properties,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdAmongst 2D materials, MoS2 with highly exposed atomic edges and large specific surface area are considered potentially strong candidates for optoelectronic devices such as photogenerated electron transport layer, saturated/reverse saturated light absorber. With these prospects in mind, doped nanohybrid system was employed as a “accelerator” for problems related to conductivity and field emission. Herein, the horizontal-vertical stacked Ag/MoS2 films including horizontal nanolayer and vertical nanosheets (NSs) was firstly presented, which exhibit excellent carrier mobility and luminescence characteristics. We have confirmed that the morphology of the Ag/MoS2 NSs (including microworm-like, worm-like, and sheet-like shape), Ag content, micro strain and crystallinity can be adjusted under the different substrate temperature. Base on anisotropy bonding and ultrafast chemical conversion effect of MoS2, the cross-layer diffusion of sputtered atoms is suppressed, thereby the subsequent deposited atoms preferring to diffuse along the van der Waals gap. The efficient light-matter interaction and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) effect is introduced by the abundant exposed S-edges of horizontal-vertical stacked Ag-MoS2 nanostructure, which lead to excellent Raman signal and linear absorption characteristic. The carrier mobility and concentration of Ag/MoS2 NSs with excellent electrical behavior has reached 4480 cm2 V-1S-1 and 3.272 × 1018 cm−2, which can be regarded as the unique ohmic contact and the electron injection effect. Further, the luminescence performance (visible light region) of horizontal-vertical stacked Ag/MoS2-350 °C NSs is 2.5 times higher than that of the original MoS2 NSs, which is dominated by the hot electron injection effect. Importantly, the carrier relaxation time guided by the nonradiative recombination behavior of Ag/MoS2-350 °C NSs was not significantly changed by the incorporation of Ag nanoparticles. The above phenomenon implies that the hot electron injection effect mainly promotes the photoluminescence behavior induced by radiative recombination. The homogeneous and controllable Ag/MoS2 NSs exhibits excellent multiple optoelectronic properties, which can provide a valuable reference strategy for the application of optoelectronic nano-film materials.",Optics and Laser Technology
Nickel-induced charge redistribution in Ni-Fe/Fe3C@nitrogen-doped carbon nanocage as a robust Mott-Schottky bi-functional oxygen catalyst for rechargeable Zn-air battery,"© 2022 Elsevier Inc.Designing earth-abundant and advanced bi-functional oxygen electrodes for efficient oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are extremely urgent but still ambiguous. Thus, metal-semiconductor nanohybrids were developed with functionally integrating ORR-active Ni species, OER-active Fe/Fe3C components, and multifunctional N-doped carbon (NDC) support. Expectantly, the resulted NDC nanocage embedded with Ni-Fe alloy and Fe3C particles, as assembled Mott-Schottky-typed catalyst, delivered a promoted half-wave potential of 0.904 V for ORR and a low overpotential of 315 mV at 10 mA/cm2 for OER both in alkaline media, outperforming those of commercial Pt/C and RuO2 counterparts. Most importantly, the optimized Ni-Fe/Fe3C@NDC sample also afforded a peak power density of 267.5 mW/cm2 with a specific capacity of 773.8 mAh/gZn and excellent durability over 80 h when used as the air electrode in rechargeable Zn-air batteries, superior to the state-of-the-art bi-functional catalysts. Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy revealed that the introduction of Ni into the Fe/Fe3C@NDC component could well manipulate the electronic structure of the designed electrocatalyst, leading to an effective built-in electric field established by the Mott-Schottky heterojunction to expedite the continuous interfacial charge-transfer and thus significantly promote the utilization of electrocatalytic active sites. Therefore, this work provides an avenue for the designing and developing robust and durable Mott-Schottky-typed bi-functional catalysts for promising energy conversion.",Journal of Colloid and Interface Science
Efficient activation of persulfate by C@Fe3O4 in visible-light for tetracycline degradation,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdA C@Fe3O4 material, Fe3O4 coated with carbon, was prepared by a simple one-pot hydrothermal method. The C@Fe3O4 material was investigated with persulfate (PS) and light to degrade tetracycline (TC) as a function of pH, aeration conditions and quenching. Experimental results suggest that TC was effectively degraded in the C@Fe3O4/PS/Vis system. In addition, due to the availability of different main active species in this catalytic system, TC degradation was possible under both strong acid and strong alkali pH conditions. The presence of dissolved oxygen can also generate oxygen-active species, such as superoxide radicals (O2•-) and singlet oxygen (1O2), to decompose TC organic matter in solution. Simply put, C@Fe3O4/PS/Vis catalytic system removed pollutants by the formation of O2•-, 1O2, hydroxyl radicals (•OH) and sulfate radicals (SO4•-) species for degrading TC. In addition, the stability of the C@Fe3O4 material was found to be outstanding.",Chemosphere
Effect of substituent in the acceptor on optical and electronic properties of triphenylamine based dyes: A density functional theory/time-dependent density functional theory investigation,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdThe performance of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) depends on the absorption of light by dye molecules and subsequent charge transfer to metal-oxide semiconductors. In this study, triphenylamine based dyes have been modified theoretically by replacing the S atom in the benzothiazole unit with NH, O, Se and Te substituents; the optical and electronic properties of the novel sensitizers were investigated using density functional theory and time-dependent density functional theory. Besides the influence of the substituents on the optoelectronic properties, the effects of two anchoring groups, namely cyanoacrylic acid and hydantoin have been examined. The features, such as red-shifted electronic absorption spectra, improved when sulfur was replaced by oxygen, selenium, or tellurium. In comparison to cyanoacrylic acid-dyes, a more spontaneous charge injection is anticipated with hydantoin-dyes. The calculated binding energies of the dyes with (TiO2)6 cluster varied from −7.6 to −9.4 eV increasing with heteroatom size increase. Heavier chalcogen-containing (Se and Te) dyes are worthy of experimental synthesis for use in higher perfomance DSSCs.",Materials Science in Semiconductor Processing

Therefore, it serves as an effective approach to combating high concentrations of CO2 in the atmosphere as well as reducing the use of fossil fuels responsible for emitting carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, meeting growing energy demands. In this work, the copper(II) bis-triazine bipyridine complex supported on carbon black has been applied as a catalyst in a polymeric electrolytic reactor – fuel cell type for converting CO2 into methanol. The physical and nanostructure properties of the Cu(II) nanocomposite were previously determined by Fourier transform infrared, Raman spectroscopy, X-ray powder diffraction, and transmission electron microscopy techniques. The electrocatalytic activity of the Cu complex catalyst was monitory by differential mass spectroscopy. The results indicate that the catalyst is not selective for the preferential synthesis of a specific product, but a mixture of products (methanol, formic acid, formaldehyde, carbon monoxide, and methane) was detected. According to our results, 2.5% and 5% Cu complex on carbon black were the ideal amounts for polymeric electrolytic reactor – fuel cell type applications to produce methanol from CO2 with faradaic efficiency of ∼22% for both compositions.",Materials Today Sustainability
Controlled Synthesis of High-index Faceted Pt nanocatalysts Directly on Carbon Paper for Methanol Electrooxidation,"© 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.Platinum (Pt) nanocatalysts as the best catalysts for direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC) still face a huge challenge such as high cost, low utilization rate, activity and stability to be improved. Adjusting the surface structure of Pt nanoparticles (NPs) to achieve high-index facets with more active sites is an effective method to resolve the problems. Furthermore, the controlled synthesis of high-index faceted Pt (HIF-Pt) nanocatalysts directly on carbon paper, which is an important component of membrane electrode, can greatly promote the practical application of HIF-Pt nanocatalysts in DMFC. Herein, the HIF-Pt nanocatalysts supported on carbon paper (HIF-Pt/CP) were realized by developing an electrochemically controlled synthesis method. The fishbone-like and concave cube shaped Pt NPs surrounded by some high-index facets such as (200), (220), and (311), were achieved by adjusting the frequency and treatment time of applied potential. Hence, these HIF-Pt/CPs exhibit excellent activity and stability towards methanol electrooxidation during both cyclic voltammetry characterization and potentiostatic test. Especially, the specific activities and mass activities of HIF-Pt/CP-1 Hz reached 3.78 mA·cm−2 and 1.53 A·mg−1, which were 6.5 and 2.78 times higher than those of commercial Pt/C, respectively.

Sustainable generator and in-situ monitor for reactive oxygen species using photodynamic effect of single-walled carbon nanotubes in ionic liquids,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdDue to the increasing concerns regarding public health and climate change, disinfectant generator technologies that utilize green processes are becoming necessary. It has been confirmed that single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) can generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) in aqueous media when illuminated with solar irradiation. However, low efficiency due to competitive reactions between ROS and water and unclear kinetics hinder their potential practical applications. To overcome these limitations, here, SWCNTs were studied in a non-aqueous ionic liquid (IL) to form a suspension system for generating superoxide (O2−) under UV light. The as-obtained O2− from SWCNTs was qualitatively confirmed by electron paramagnetic resonance and UV–vis spectroscopy. The sustainability of the new SWCNTs/IL system was confirmed by UV–vis and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy. The IL proved to be an ideal media that could extend the lifetime of O2− from a few microseconds (generated in water) to at least 65 h in the IL. The kinetics of photodynamic effect were investigated by electrochemical characterizations. A new method was established to in-situ monitor the O2− level in the IL system. The O2− level in the IL was quantitatively determined by combining cyclic voltammetry and chronoamperometry techniques. The SWCNTs/IL system generated 4.11 mM of O2− in a mini-scale generator, which was in excess of germicidal levels for ROS. The sustainable, long duration and high-yield of the generator exhibited excellent potential as a generator as well as an in-situ monitor for O2−. This work could pave the way for O2− generation using SWCNTs and promote its applications in air and water disinfection for public health, as well as O2− sensitive chemical sensors for monitoring the environmental quality.",Materials Today Sustainability
